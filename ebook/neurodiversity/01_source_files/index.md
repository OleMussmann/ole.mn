# What is This About?

> Isn't {{< term "ADHD">}} a schoolboy's thing? Is it a superpower, a gift, a curse? Why should we ever hire mentally disabled people? And how can we stop this {{< term "autism" >}} epidemic?

Still with me? Good. With that out of the way, I'd like to bring detail and nuance into the discussion and supply perspectives I see lacking all too often. This book explores the impact of neurodiversity on the workplace and aims to give guidance to _you_, whether you are being managed, or manage people yourself.

Despite the recent uptick in diagnoses for invisible disabilities like {{< term "ADHD">}}, {{< term "autism">}} and other disorders from the {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} {{< term "spectrum" >}}[^relevant_magazine], the lived reality of those conditions _still_ collides with stereotypes. This means that it's quite likely that you miss signs of neurodiversity either in yourself or your colleagues[^chances]. Furthermore, the implications on everyday life and work life outside of a clinical context don't seem to be well understood, which causes unnecessary struggles for both managers and managed people.

Even if you don't take away much that applies to you personally, after chewing through four chapters spitting facts about why "being different" might be different than you think, you might be able to support your colleagues better. You will get tips on how to maximize their potential, reduce stress, and create a work environment where your colleagues will go through fire for you [^fire]. And who knows, you might even create a better environment for yourself.

[^chances]: See Chapter [Flavors and Prevalence](#flavors-and-prevalence).
[^fire]: Ok, I made this one up. But only a little bit. Companies that embrace {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} report significantly higher retention rates, according to this [whitepaper from justapp.ai](https://justapply.app/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Justappl-whitepaper-Neurodiversity-in-the-Workplace-A-Quantitative-Analysis-of-Performance_-Innovation_-and-Retention_V3.pdf) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2023/11/08/unlocking-hidden-talent-the-power-of-neurodiversity-in-modern-organizations/).

# Neurodiversity 101

**Definitions, overview, statistics**


## What is Neurodiversity?
{{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} describes the {{< term "spectrum" >}} of ways of how different people's brains work. This usually includes {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people.

> {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} is a nonmedical term that describes people whose brains develop or work differently for some reason. This means the person has different strengths and struggles from people whose brains develop or work more typically. While some people who are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} have medical conditions, it also happens to people where a medical condition or diagnosis hasn’t been identified.
>
>
> -- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23154-neurodivergent)

Don't worry, we will delve into the terminology [below](#terminology). It's also for now not important to get all of these right. Work environments are set up for an "average" worker, with "average" needs. {{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} in the workplace looks at what happens if some, or even many employees have different strengths and weaknesses than the average workplace is designed for.

### Terminology


We will explore other special terms as we encounter them. You will recognize them when they have a faint dotted underline, which means that you can get an explanation about them when you hover your mouse over the words. In any case, you can also look them up in a handy [glossary](#glossary), which provides extra context as well as resources to learn more about them.


For now, here's a brief primer of the most important ones.

- A person can be {{< term "neurodivergent">}} when the working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline.
- A group can be {{< term "neurodiverse">}}, when their brains work differently from one another.
- If not, they are {{< term "neurotypical">}}.
- Neurological differences or disorders are said to be a "{{< term "spectrum" >}}", acknowledging that they can vastly differ in severity or expression from non-existent to very strong.

### The Spectrum

Behold, the {{< term "spectrum" >}} of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}}...

![Colorful disks arranged in a circle. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum_01.png#nowebp#light#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}}")
![Colorful disks arranged in a circle. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum_01_dark.png#nowebp#dark#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}}")

... or at least how one could imagine it, or how you often find it [on the internet](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=neurodivergence+spectrum&ia=images&atb=v369-1). Spoiler alert, it is not accurate. But maybe in different ways than you might expect. What does this picture get right? There's more than one way to be {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}. A person could have OCD. Or {{< term "ADHD" >}}. Or something else. All of these would be considered "{{< term "neurodivergent" >}}".

Yes, there's "Cultural Diversity" in the picture. Put the pitchforks down, it's obviously not a neurological condition. It is not a disability either. It can, however, have a similar impact on people and their surroundings. If you grow up in a different culture, you are used to different ways of thinking, communicating, or problem solving. Those are also the traits of many conditions that can make people neurodivergent. For considering how to improve people's lives or how to get the most out of employees, many of the same recommendations apply.

So what is wrong with this picture then?

It's not only that people can have {{< term "ADHD" >}} or not, there are also different expression of the same condition as well as differet severities. Yes, you can be "a bit" {{< term "ADHD" >}} or "slightly" {{< term "autistic" >}}. Whether that qualifies for a diagnosis or not depends on a certain threshold of criteria and, yes, also to some extent on the doctors that diagnose you. None of this matters for this discussion, though. Diagnosed, undiagnosed, self-diagnosed, it matters not. What _does_ matter are people's strengths and weaknesses as well as the challenges they face in their lives and in the workplace.

Let's fix the {{< term "spectrum" >}}.

![Colorful disks arranged in a circle, fading out towards the center. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum.png#nowebp#light#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} (fixed)")
![Colorful disks arranged in a circle, fading out towards the center. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum_dark.png#nowebp#dark#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} (fixed)")

A person can have strong {{< term "CPTSD" >}} and {{< term "autism" >}}, a bit of {{< term "dyslexia" >}} and with this cocktail surely also a dash of anxiety.

You have now a clearer understanding what people talk about when they mention the "{{< term "spectrum" >}}" of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}}.

## Flavors and Prevalence

I cannot tell you how many of your colleagues are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}, but we can make an estimation together. Using a kind of global average will be skewed, due to the fact that you are reading a tech blog (you and your surroundings would, anectotically, have a higher prevalence of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}}), and due to the fact that {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people unfortunately have a much higher chance to be unemployed (thus lowering the probability for your colleagues). Chance for unemployment is, in fact, 3x higher for {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people than for any other disability and up to 8x higher than having no disability [^unemployment].

It is no surprise then that a UK-based _Diversity in Tech_ report states that their interviewed employers estimate that 3% of their employees are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}. However, more than half(!) of their employees self-identify as {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} when asked directly [^diversity_in_tech].

Since certain factors increase the prevalence and other decrease them, I will stick to the global average to convey an intuition for prevalence for the sake of this discussion.

[^unemployment]: https://mydisabilityjobs.com/statistics/neurodiversity-in-the-workplace/
[^diversity_in_tech]: https://www.techtalentcharter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/diversity-in-tech-report-2024.pdf

The big take-away first: the general prevalence of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} is 15-20%[^prevalence]. This means:

[^prevalence]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732033/

> About 1-in-5 to 1-in-7 people have a brain that works somewhat differently.

This is a lot. Think about how many people you know, privately or professionally. Would you have expected such a high percentage? If not, could you think of reasons why your peers either don't know they are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}, or are not telling you? We will come back to that topic a bit later. Until then, ponder upon it.

Let's break that down into different flavors.

### Neurodivergence Starter Pack

First we have a look at the {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} Starter Pack, which are conditions that you are usually born with. Here are the most common ones. Hover your mouse over the terms for a brief explanation.

| condition | prevalence |
| --- | --- |
| {{< term "ADHD" >}} | 11% [^adhd_prevalence] |
| {{< term "Dyslexia" >}} | 10% [^dyslexia_prevalence] |
| {{< term "Dysgraphia" >}} | 7-15% [^dysgraphia_prevalence] |
| {{< term "Dyscalculia" >}} | 6% [^dyscalculia_prevalence] |
| ... | ... |

[^adhd_prevalence]: https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/data/index.html
[^dyslexia_prevalence]: https://worldmetrics.org/dyslexia-statistics/
[^dysgraphia_prevalence]: https://www.thetreetop.com/statistics/learning-disabilities-statistics
[^dyscalculia_prevalence]: https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyscalculia/how-can-i-identify-dyscalculia

### Neurodivergence DLC

Next, there is the {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} Downloable Content (DLC)[^dlc], which are traits you can acquire (or get rid of) during your life. The prevalence here is the chance that any one person might suffer from these disorders now, or in the future.

[^dlc]: "Downloadable content (DLC) is additional content created for an already released video game [...]", from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content N.B.: These are obviously not medical terms.

| condition | prevalence |
| --- | --- |
| Anxiety Disorder | 19% [^anxiety_prevalence] |
| Depression | 5% [^depression_prevalence] |
| {{< term "CPTSD" >}} | 4% [^ptsd_prevalence] |
| ... | ... |
| {{< term "Dissociative Identity Disorder" >}} | 1.5% [^did_prevalence] |


[^anxiety_prevalence]: https://www.usa.edu/blog/mental-health-statistics/
[^depression_prevalence]: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression
[^ptsd_prevalence]: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/post-traumatic-stress-disorder
[^did_prevalence]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568768/

Here I singled out the {{< term "Dissociative Identity Disorder" >}}, previously known as the "Multiple Personality Disorder". A prevalence of 1.5% seems pretty low, right? Do you know anybody who has multiple, distinct personalities? Probably not. And yet you have met, and interacted with, so many people in your life until now. I can almost guarantee you that you have met multiple people with this disorder. And none of those people told you about such a large aspect of their life. Why not? Food for thought.

## A Note on Disability
Statistically speaking, it is rather likely you do not consider yourself disabled. For the sake of this argument, I would like to assume that this is the case. Not being disabled is the "default". It is "how people are supposed to be". Even if we ignore the toxicity of these statements for a second, it is a problematic way of thinking that I would like to challenge. During our lives it is very likely that we, eventually, _will_ become physically or mentally disabled. When we think about the needs of disabled people, we need to keep in mind that this will concern us as well, personally, somewhere down the line.

> Instead, I recommend that you consider yourself "temporarily able-bodied/minded".

There are different approaches to think about disabilities. Let's highlight two of those.

### Medical Model of Disability

The medical model of disability sees disabilities as _intrinsic_ in a person, as a deficit that can (maybe) be cured or managed. You have difficulties walking? Here, take this exo-skeleton. You are became deaf? A [cochlear implant](https://www.healthline.com/health/cochlear-implant) takes care of that. Now you are, again, a well-functioning member of society. That seems pretty nice, does it not?

There are several issues with this approach.

The medical model looks at what's "wrong" with a person, disregarding what that person might actually need. Some people strongly identify with their disability. As an example, deaf people might not percieve their disability as a deficit. "Deaf culture" is something that a person might not want to leave behind by being "cured"[^deaf_culture]. Autistic people often see their character traits as something inherent, as something that defines them. Without it, they would be different people.

[^deaf_culture]: https://www.healthline.com/health/why-cochlear-implants-are-bad

Furthermore, the medical model of disability reinforces the stigma of disability, as something to be avoided, to be feared, especially if we see ourselves as temporarily able-bodied/minded.

Can we think about disabilities in a different way?

### Social Model of Disability

The social model of disability sees the impairment as _extrinsic_. The disability comes through societal barriers or {{< term "ableism" >}}, and the focus lies on the removal of barriers. It is a bit abstract, so what does that look like in real life? A person in a wheelchair might have problems crossing the street, because the wheelchair is not well suited for going up and down the curb. At crossings, the curb is often lowered. This enables wheelchair users to safely cross the street, it literally removes a barrier. The kicker is that wheelchair users are not the only ones that benefit from this accommodation. Parents pushing a stroller? Cyclists? Old people that have troubles lifting their feet? You, pushing a shopping cart? All of those people benefit.

An autistic person might have challenges improvising in work meetings. They might be nervous because they can't anticipate what is being discussed and would want to prepare well to reduce their anxiety. Imagine that your work meetings had a well-defined title and agenda. Even if you are not autistic yourself, would that not be nice? You could see at a glance what the meeting is about and assess if you need to do some last-minute preparations.

I would argue that {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} falls, for the most part, into the social model of disability. Barring some exceptions[^autism_medical], the challenges of neurodivergent people arise from being embedded in a world that is built for brains that function differently than theirs. One way of functioning is not inherently better or worse than the other.

[^autism_medical]: If an autistic person feels so uncomfortable in their own body that they want to tear the skin off their bones, than this is something inherent in that person. No degree of accomodation will be able to fix that.

I do not want to point a finger at people and accuse them of putting up those barriers. It would be a pointless exercise, because we all do. Yes, you, dear reader, put up barriers that makes other people's lives more difficult. Your boss does. Your colleagues do. I do. It is not our fault, we are brought up this way and we don't know better (yet). I would claim, however, that it is our responsibility to tear down those barriers when possible. This means actively listening to people, their stories and their needs. It can, in the beginning, be an uncomfortable process. You will be challenged in your beliefs and habits. The journey can be, however, incredibly rewarding. You have the power to meaningfully improve people's lives, including your own, if you dare.

>  Disability is a product of societal barriers we create. This means that we can take those barriers away again.

### Accomodations

Our {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues can be more sensitive to barriers in the workplace than our {{< term "neurotypical" >}} ones. We can see them as canaries in a coal mine, as means to "take the temperature" of our ways of working. The barriers that bother them most will probably also hinder neurotypicals. Who would not like to have a quiet place to focus sometimes? Who would not benefit from clear, concise communication?

> The aim is not to create special rules and accommodations specifically for {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues. It is to improve all of our lives.



We will explore possible accommodations later in Chapter ["Break Glass in Case of Neurodiversity"](#break-glass-in-case-of-neurodiversity).


{{< flourish 9 >}}



Now we have a rough idea about what {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} is and how common it is. You might be surprised that {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} occurs more often that you imagined. This is not too surprising. To understand this better, in the following chapter we will study the public perception of {{< term "neurodiversity" >}}.



<!-- Part 2: "Neurodiversity at the Workplace": ⬅ Public perception of neurodiversity is off, by about this much ➡ -->




# Stereotypes vs. Reality
**⬅️ Public perception of neurodiversity is off, by about this much ➡️**


## Public Perception
You have read now quite a bit about what {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} means and how many people are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}. You may wonder how on earth you have underestimated the extent of how many people think differently. Rest assured, there are good reasons for that. Almost the entirety of this post is dedicated to exloring the various ways how {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} can fly under the radar.

## Invisible Disabilities
{{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} is, for the most part, invisible. People on the {{< term "spectrum" >}} usually do not have any symptoms that can be spotted from the outside. Their {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} might even be invisible to themselves. Why, though, would people not realize they themselves are on the spectrum? Or if they do know, why would they not share this fact with you? Let's explore the many reasons together.

### Lack of Knowledge
Many {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people do indeed not know they are on the spectrum. More and more people get their diagnoses later in their adult life[^ft]. Why would that be? Our social environment shapes our self-image. We tend to surround ourselves with people who we feel comfortable with, with whom we feel at ease interacting with. {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} people might surround themselves with like-minded people, not realizing that a large part of the population thinks and behaves a bit differently. Yes, being smart humans and all, we have the [Theory of Mind](https://www.simplypsychology.org/theory-of-mind.html), and on a general level we know that other people have different needs, desires etc. It happens not often, but regularly, that I meet people who approach life from a very different angle, or people that are driven by something that is alien to me. Maybe you have experienced the same? Our tendency to assume that people that surround us think like we do makes us underestimate the extent of how diverse humans actually are.

[^ft]: https://www.ft.com/content/e1ec787f-9089-4afb-9e53-8e69e3d45405

If a person does not know they are on the {{< term "spectrum" >}}, they cannot communicate it to their environment. Certain needs tied to their {{< term "neurotype" >}} might not be obvious to them.

To understand where this lack of knowledge comes from, let's play.

### "Diagnose Random People": A Game
Let's play a game. I will show you some images, and you tell me the mental disorder the depicted might have [^game]. What disorder could this feline suffer from?

[^game]: This is for instructional purposes only. _Please do not do this in real life._

![Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh jumping up and down](./film__4196-the-tigger-movie--hi_res-2efa8963.jpg#nowebp#small "Image from [intofilm.org](https://www.intofilm.org/films/4196), © DISNEY")

Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh has tons of energy, is often in other people's faces (being "too much?"), has attention issues and bounces on his tail a lot.

{{< details summary="Solution" >}}
One could say that Tigger has a Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
{{< /details >}}

How about "real" people instead of cartoons? What disorder would you attribute to Sheldon?

![Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory series, looking smug](./sheldon.jpg#nowebp#small "Image from [fandom.com](https://freshy-kanal-cinematic-wiki.fandom.com/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper), © Warner Bros.")

Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory series is an unworldly nerd. He is self-centerd, highly intelligent, has sensory issues and can't really relate to other people and their needs. This combination makes him come across as rude.

{{< details summary="Solution" >}}
This sounds a lot like he could suffer from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
{{< /details >}}

We have certain ideas what neurodivergent people "should" look like. A typical {{< term "autistic" >}} person is usually an aloof white male. A person suffering from {{< term "ADHD" >}} would be, surprise, also white and male, maybe a boy. For the off chance that it's a women, then she's young, bubbly and has a fun personality. And yeah, of course she's also white. The lived reality is usually rather different. Let's dismantle some stereotypes.

### Stereotypes



In the previous Chapter ["Neurodiversity 101"](#neurodiversity-101) I hinted at the fact that mental disorders can express themselves in different ways. Here's a concrete example. The "inattentive type" {{< term "ADHD" >}} causes restlessness in the mind, not in the body. Think about a scatterbrained professor[^professor]. This is also the dominant type in women and often underdiagnosed [^underdiagnosed]. Women, people of color, and queer people are late- or underdiagnosed for neurodivergent disorders in general[^adhd_color] [^ps_today].


[^professor]: What image do you have in mind here? An old-ish white male?
[^underdiagnosed]: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24741-adhd-in-women
[^adhd_color]: https://www.additudemag.com/race-and-adhd-how-people-of-color-get-left-behind/
[^ps_today]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/wildly-neurodivergent/202502/why-late-diagnoses-hit-different

Another shocker, {{< term "autistic" >}} people usually _don't_ lack empathy. They communicate and perceive feelings differently and the mismatch lies in the communication, not the empathy[^empathy]. Some autistic people are even unusually strongly tuned in to other people's emotions and feelings[^hyper_empathy], which can be a blessing and a curse.

[^empathy]: https://leader.pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/leader.FTR2.25042020.58
[^hyper_empathy]: https://neurolaunch.com/hyper-empathy-autism/

### Playing "Spot the Depressed Person"

Last game, spot the depressed person.

![People are sitting in a metro. In the foreground, a grumpy old man. Next to him the text "Steffen has depression". Slightly blurry, in the background are two more happy looking people. Next to one is written "This is Steffen".](./depression.jpg#nowebp "Image from [@The_AdProfessor](https://x.com/The_AdProfessor/status/1746913856935579716), © deutsche-depressionshilfe.de")

We have certain expectations of what a depressed person "should" look like. Sad and probably introvert. Instead, they usually put on a happy face for the world. It's almost like they are wearing a mask. A similar thing happens for other mental conditions. People usually try to blend in and appear "normal"[^masking].

[^masking]: https://www.psychreg.org/masking-what-why-neurodivergent-people-do-it/

### Masking

We often act a certain way to camouflage into our social environment. This is called "{{< term "masking" >}}" and {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people do this _a lot_. Why would that be? Maybe a cheesy Instagram meme has the answer.

> Society: Be yourself.
>
> Society: No, not like that!

Ignoring a maybe unhealthy layer of victimization, there is a kernel of truth here. By the time kids with {{< term "ADHD" >}} are 10 years old, they could receive _in school alone_ 20.000(!) more negative comments than their peers[^negative_comments]. What would that do to someone's self-esteem? Whether we like it or not, humans are social animals and we rely on being accepted into our "tribe". Behavior that goes against societal expectations is corrected harshly.

[^negative_comments]: https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/23971/pediatrics/dont-let-adhd-crush-childrens-self-esteem

{{< term "Masking" >}} is a learned coping strategy to blend in. This is not necessarily a conscious process and it costs a lot of energy, increases stress and increases the risk for burnout[^burnout]. Trying to act like you are a different person also erodes the sense of self[^self]. At the end of the day, who are you, really? Where does the mask end and the _you_ start? It's not a healthy process.

[^burnout]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-neurodivergence/202405/burnout-and-neurodiversity
[^self]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/positively-different/202411/the-strain-of-masking-reclaiming-our-neurodivergent-selves

I'm not saying nobody should {{< term "mask" >}} anymore; the little devil on our shoulders should not take over our lives. We live in a society and we need to get along with each other. {{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} is _not_ an excuse for bad behavior. {{< term "Masking" >}}, however, needs to become a more conscious process. Furthermore, {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people need to find environments where they can take their mask off and let their guard down to recharge.

### Stigma
On one hand, stigma are bad. It perpetuates negative attitudes and stereotypes, othering people. On the other hand, nobody wants to have a disorder. It sounds yicky, and bad, right?

When talking about stigma, we need to have a look at the various forms it can come in[^stigma].

- First, there's the self-stigma. After missing the already extended deadline _again_, one might feel ashamed. Why can other people do this simple task, yet I cannot?

- Next, there's the social stigma. What are our peers thinking about us? Here's where {{< term "masking" >}} comes in. We usually strive to be accepted by our environment.

- Lastly there's the institutional stigma. This is structural discrimination in education, the workplace, or healthcare.

[^stigma]: https://www.mindworksmemphis.com/blog/breaking-down-stigmas-around-neurodiversity

A special note about the institutional stigma. Some people cannot afford to lose their job, be it that they need the income, be it that their visa depends on being employed. If people fear _any_ repercussions about disclosing potential neurodivergence, it will create an oppressive atmosphere where people will {{< term "mask" >}} as hard as they can. The consequences are increased stress and risk for burnout. So what can we do about it? Creating an inclusive atmosphere is hard, you cannot _make_ people trust you. But any steps taken towards that goal can be oh so beneficial for the mental health of your colleagues.

#### Dismantling Stigma




The first step breaking down stigma is working on the self-stigma. We will learn more about it in the Chapter ["Neurodiversity and You"](#neurodiversity-and-you), but here's a quick summary. If you (suspect you) are on the spectrum, first accept it. You are not suddenly lesser. Your {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} is not an excuse, but it is an explanation. Just like anybody else, you have certain strengths and weaknesses. Learn about them as much as you can. Find support for your weaknesses and lean into your strengths.


The social stigma is harder to tackle. Find out where you can unmask, and how much. If you are privileged enough that you can be open about your neurodiversity, gently educate your peers. Explain how your neurodiversity affects _you_, where you need support and how you can use your strong suits to support others.

Working on the institutional stigma is the long game. It takes lobbying, activism, and education. Take care of yourself first, but if you have the bandwidth for it, even a small dent can make a big impact for people's lives.

## How Do You Own Disorder, Disorder?
Should we consider {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} a disorder? When we look at {{< term "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" >}} or {{< term "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder" >}}, then, well, the disorder is in the name. With 15-20% of the population being {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}[^so_many_people], is it actually a disorder, or is it a natural variation of how people are?

[^so_many_people]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732033/

Names carry power. {{< term "ADHD" >}}, for example, is not characterized by a lack of attention, the challenge is _directing_ one's attention. This promotes a wrong impression of that disorder. Even disregarding this, with the stigma surrounding "disorder", the above names are problematic[^orchestratehealth] [^resilientmindcounseling] [^psychologytoday_disorder].

[^orchestratehealth]: https://www.orchestratehealth.com/neurodivergence-its-not-an-illness-that-needs-a-cure/
[^resilientmindcounseling]: https://resilientmindcounseling.com/neurodivergent-examples/
[^psychologytoday_disorder]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/my-life-with-aspergers/202401/neurodiversity-is-an-identity-not-a-disorder

> Neurodivergence: It’s Not An Illness That Needs a Cure
>
> -- [orchestratehealth.com](https://www.orchestratehealth.com/neurodivergence-its-not-an-illness-that-needs-a-cure/)

I don't know how to better describe them, so for now I grudgingly perpetuate this institutional stigma. Please do enlighten me if you have a better approach that is both medically correct, stigma-free, and does not diminish the fact that the difference in brain function we talk about can be actual disabilities.

## General Challenges

Finally putting stereotypes aside, what are real challenges {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} workers face? This, of course, differs per person, but here are some general aspects.

- Sensory overload can impact well-being and productivity. Bright lights, noisy visual patterns, strong smells or changes in temperature can disturb {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people more than {{< term "neurotypicals" >}}.
- People of different {{< term "neurotypes" >}} have a somewhat different way of communicating both facts and feelings. This can lead to communication gaps (both ways) when not addressed.
- Depending on their {{< term "neurotype" >}}, colleagues might prefer to work in teams, or solitary. A social environment can be very draining for, for example, some autistic people.
- {{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} often impacts the executive functioning. This makes certain tasks like time management or planning harder. Task or context switching could take longer and cost more energy.

That looks like a long list, but the accommodations for those challenges are things that help _everybody_. A quiet working environment, clear and concise communication, setting clear and reasonable expectations... Who would not benefit from those? Sign me up! While some accommodations might be specific to a person, most are "just" a generally good working environment. Hot take:

> {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues are canaries in a coalmine.

They take the temperature of the working environment. The barriers that bother them most will probably also hinder neurotypicals.

## General Benefits

If {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} workers are such high maintenance, what are they good for? I could now, of course, rave on about how amazing I personally find myself, or what I value in my {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues, but you would probably not believe me. Rightfully so. It's better to let some industry heavy-weights chime in on this.

> Many people with neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and {{< term "dyslexia" >}} have extraordinary skills, including in pattern recognition, memory, and mathematics.
>
> -- [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage)

> When companies embrace neurodiversity, they gain competitive advantages in many areas — productivity, innovation, culture and talent retention, to name just a few. A report by JPMorgan Chase [found](https://www.ft.com/content/ea9ca374-6780-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3) in _Financial Times_ (paywall) that professionals in its Autism at Work initiative made fewer errors and were 90% to 140% more productive than {{< term "neurotypical" >}} employees.
>
> -- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2022/02/15/neurodiversity-and-the-workplace/)

> Organizations that make an extra effort to recruit, retain, and nurture {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} workers can gain a competitive edge from increased diversity in skills, ways of thinking, and approaches to problem-solving.
>
> -- [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/talent/neurodiversity-in-the-workplace.html)

You get the picture. I would like to stress that my goal here is not to convince you to fill the office with autistic people. You should hire the most fitting person for a given position. But often times, this could be a {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} applicant. So make sure to be inclusive in your hiring process, so that the actually most fitting person has a chance to be in your pool.

### Specific Strengths and Challenges

Different flavors of neurodiversity can be the source of different strengths and weaknesses. While this, of course, is very dependent on the person, here are some trends[^neurobox] [^brain_charity] [^hsqe].

[^neurobox]: https://neurobox.co.uk/infographics-neurodifferences/
[^brain_charity]: https://www.thebraincharity.org.uk/seven-neurodivergent-conditions/
[^hsqe]: https://hsqe.co.uk/blog-neurodivergence-strengths-challenges-success/

| "Disability" | Challenges | Strength |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| {{< term "ADHD" >}} | maintaining focus, impulsivity, impatience, executive functioning | adaptability, creativity, hyperfocus, passion, problem solving |
| {{< term "Autism" >}} | communication, overstimulation, stress, adapting to changes | attention to detail, empathy, focus, innovation, pattern recognition |
| {{< term "Dyscalculia" >}} | understanding numbers, spatial awareness | creativity, reasoning, problem solving, resilience |
| {{< term "Dyslexia" >}} | executive functioning, concentration, reading, recalling (written) information, stress | creativity, innovation, problem solving, entrepreneurial spirit, story telling, spatial- and big picture thinking |
| {{< term "Dysgraphia" >}} | handwriting, organizing thoughts on paper | creativity, empathy, problem solving, spatial reasoning, verbal communication |
| {{< term "Dyspraxia" >}} | motor skills, balance, spacial thinking, organization | creativity, innovation, resilience, strategic thinking |

{{< flourish 6 >}}




For the next chapter I would like to shift the perspective a bit and highlight what _you_ can do if you suspect you might be on the {{< term "spectrum" >}} just got a diagnosis.



<!-- Part 3: "At Work": Tips for neurodivergent workers -->




# At Work
**Tips for neurodivergent workers**


## The Role of Culture
Imagine needing to {{< term "mask" >}} every day at work, pretending to be someone you are not. Hiding a part of yourself, hiding _yourself_. Keeping your guard up at all times, lest you accidentally over-eagerly tell your colleagues about the fun PC game you played on the weekend, just to be met with rolling eyes, being othered, making felt like you do not belong.

Now imagine a different environment, where there are more people like yourself. Where you can infodump about this niche programming problem you encountered and are not only heard, but get helpful tips on the way. Where you do not need to feel ashamed to communicate about your passion about architecture. Where you can debate which sci-fi book series is better, and why.

{{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues have a bit different way of communicating, and they are passionate about different things. Creating an environment where they feel like they belong not only makes for a pleasant working environment for them. It is now a safe space where they can be themselves. Where they do not need to spend energy to get through the day, but they recharge and thrive, maybe even more than in their everyday lives.

With such an environment, work is not just a job anymore. It is an integral part of people's lives, a place they feel connected to. An organization people are proud being a part of. I have witnessed this first hand, and it is a beautiful thing. In such an environment people are more than willing to support each other in rough times, to go the extra mile and put their heart and soul into their work, and it shows.

This does not mean that you need to have an organization with only {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people - a monoculture, whichever way, is not healthy. You need enough to create a sense of belonging and an environment that enables them. What that would look like, depends on the workplace and the people. Also keep in mind that it does take a certain investment to be open and inclusive, but I can assure you it _will_ pay off in the long run.

Once you create a welcoming work environment and -culture, it needs protection and nurturing. It can be damaged or destroyed in various ways.

It can slowly erode over time. If vulnerable colleagues do not feel welcome anymore, they start to leave. It creates a runaway effect until you are left with a monoculture again. Or it can degrade quickly by mismanagement or violated trust. I have seen both, and both could have been probably prevented by better communication, by actively listening, without bias or assumptions, to vulnerable colleagues or colleagues who decide to leave.

### Just Work
On the flipside it can be difficult for {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues to understand that for some others work is "just" work. A way to pay the bills. Those colleagues would be much more indifferent to changes in the work environment. Their passions lie more outside of the office. We don't have to share the same belief and one approach is not better than the other. It is, however, imporant to understand each other's motivation, so we know where other people are coming from and what work and the work environment means for them.

## For Allies
{{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues might have specific needs. If this is the case, hopefully they will tell you about them. However, not everyone will be outspoken about their {{< term "neurodiversity" >}}, for the many reasons listed in the previous posts. So instead of only catering to the needs that our colleagues voice, we should also try to adopt general improvements to our communication, behavior, and work culture. You don’t have to assume anything about your peers to be a supportive colleague and an efficient communicator.

These are Ohio's guidelines[^permission_ohio] for interacting with people who are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}:

[^permission_ohio]: Copyright by _Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities_, printed with permission. Original source: https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/ood.ohio.gov/Literature/ERAH_Neurodiversity%20at%20Work_Learner's%20Guide.pdf

- Be direct with your questions.
- Communicate clearly and concisely.
- Avoid jargon and slang terms.
- Be patient and give the person time to respond.
- Remain comfortable with breaks in conversation.
- If you are asked to repeat a question, try to explain it in a different way.
- It may be helpful to write information down or use images.
- Look past the physical symptoms and behaviors and see the unique person inside.
- Ignore repetitive behaviors as you would ignore someone twirling their hair with their fingers.
- Always presume competence.
- Talk to the person, not about the person. Just because a person may have challenges with communicating, does not mean they can't understand what you're saying.
- Don't take it personally if a person responds to you bluntly or makes a frank comment. Respond in a straightforward manner that explains why the response was inappropriate and give them a specific example of a more appropriate response

This list of recommendations aims to help {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues, but how would neurotypicals perceive those? Would they be disadvantaged? Supported? How do you perceive them for yourself?

## For Managers
Try to approach your colleagues from a place of curiosity. They might not be open to you about the way their brain works, but this is (most likely) not about you as a person. They could have their personal reasons to hide it, or they might be intimidated by (perceived) power differences between you.

If there are unmet expectations, there’s usually reasons for it, and laziness is not one of them [^lazy]. "If you were lazy, you'd be having fun." {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues who fall behind in their workload are usually ashamed about it. Working harder does not solve the underlying issue, working smarter might. Finding the right approach to productivity can be challenging and it helps to have supportive, non-judgmental guidance. This also means that you have to manage _people_, and not just content. As an ally removing barriers, you can be an incredible multiplier. This way we can lean more strongly into the benefits that our {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues bring to the table.

[^lazy]: https://www.supersummary.com/laziness-does-not-exist/summary/

## For Managed People
First and foremost, learn about your needs. Experiment with different approaches to work. What works for most people might not work for you.

Next, voice your needs, if you can. Be outspoken to your colleagues, if you can. This not only helps you build the work environment that you need, it normalizes talking about {{< term "neurodiversity" >}}. If you are privileged enough to be open about your disabilities, it paves the way for others who, for whatever reason, cannot speak out (yet). Be the ambassador. Be the catalyst.

Being {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} means that you get to question a lot of assumptions about what a work environment can look like. Remember, what helps you or your {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues is, most likely, also beneficial for your {{< term "neurotypical" >}} colleagues. What you perceive as "typical", might not be. This can be a signs of a need from you or others! It takes an open mind an a lot of curiosity, but you have the power to be a force of good.

Focus on the destination, not the path. You might need unconventional approaches to get your work done. You concentrate best in the evening? Try to ride that late-day energy wave. Having your dog around makes you calm and helps you focus? Make use of that whenever you can. This does not mean that your needs trump all others. Be mindful of other people's needs and make constructive agreements.

Lastly, make use of the resources available to you. You might have access to confidential advisors, company doctors or psychologists. Fellow {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues have open ears for your struggles and maybe can give you pointers. Lean into, or build your personal support network as well, like friends or family, and get a diagnosis if you need access to extra resources like coaching, therapy or medication.

Let's watch out for each other.

{{< flourish 9 >}}




Next, we focus on _you_ and have a look at how you can do if you suspect being on the {{< term "spectrum" >}} or just got a diagnosis.



<!-- Part 4: "Break Glass in Case of Neurodiversity": What to do if you suspect being on the spectrum or just got a diagnosis -->




# Break Glass in Case of Neurodiversity
**What to do if you suspect being on the spectrum or just got a diagnosis**


## Neurodiversity and You

Suspecting or finding out that you are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} can be confusing or disorienting. Know that the "labels" of specific neurodivergences do not change who you are. While some find it comforting to accept a label (the struggle has a name now), others reject labels for themselves, especially when some still have stigmas attached to them. What is important – whether on a spectrum or not – are your needs. Disregarding whether you accept those labels or not, they can help you find out more about how your brain works and what you need to be balanced and productive.

You spent your whole life being you. The things _you_ find typical, like the things you find easy or hard, might be perceived rather differently by your colleagues. This can be a sign of a need, either from you or others. Try identifying those needs.

You and your colleagues might have different approaches for getting certain tasks done. You need to be isolated, with a warm cup of tea and noise-cancelling headphones? Go for it. You need to be surrounded by colleagues that hold you accountable and spur you on? Try to organize this. There is no one, right way to be productive. Focus on the destination and find your own path.

## Getting Help

Whatever your challenges, you don’t have to face them alone. If you feel comfortable with it, speak with your team and line manager about it. If you have them, you can anonymously approach your confidential advisors. Also consider asking a professional for help. While you are unique in your struggles, therapists will have met many others with comparable challenges and can help you in very targeted ways.

### Accommodations

If you need support to do your work (well), what reasonable accommodations are you entitled to? This obviously differs by where in the world you currently work. As a starter, these are some examples from EU rules [^eu_rules]:

[^eu_rules]: https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/employee-rights-representation/reasonable-accommodation/index_en.htm under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

- An on-site job coach for individuals with cognitive disabilities to help with training and task management.
- Job restructuring to redistribute marginal tasks that an employee with a disability cannot perform to other team members.
- Allowing telework or remote work for employees who have difficulty commuting or need a controlled environment due to sensory sensitivities.
- Modifying job responsibilities to focus on strengths and capabilities rather than limitations, such as assigning a visually impaired employee to a role that primarily involves auditory tasks.

Looking at a different corner of the world, the State of Ohio published a detailed list [^permission_ohio]. We can take inspiration from it.

[^permission_ohio]: Copyright by _[Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities](https://ood.ohio.gov/)_, printed with permission. Original source: https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/ood.ohio.gov/Literature/ERAH_Neurodiversity%20at%20Work_Learner's%20Guide.pdf

- Reasonable accommodations for work
  - Making the work environment accessible
    - Relocate the workstation away from an open office space with distractions for an employee with sensory processing needs.
    - Install overhead LED lighting and lighting systems that permit adjustments to brightness for employees who are sensitive to standard lighting.
    - Permit adjustments to thermostats for employees with sensitivity to temperatures, such as intense heat. 
    - Provide a fragrance-free environment for employees with sensory processing needs.
  - Restructuring a job
    - Permit telework to avoid sensory sensitivities, reduce social demands, and improve concentration for work tasks.
    - Restructure essential functions to be supported with organized priorities, breaking large tasks into smaller steps, and clear guidelines for timelines.
    - Provide instructions in written, emailed, or recorded format for the employee to reference as needed.
    - Organize written communications by using bullet points instead of long paragraphs and section headers in documents.
  - Permitting a flexible schedule
    - Reduce exposure to distractions like noise by permitting an employee to work flexible hours when fewer people are in the workplace.
    - Permit a later start time to avoid traveling during peak travel times that can be difficult with an employee with sensory processing needs.
    - Provide a modified break schedule to permit the employee to manage their needs during the workday, such as taking a break to call a family member for support or to have a movement break.
  - Altering or providing equipment or services
    - Provide noise-cancelling headphones or earbuds to reduce the distraction of noise in the workplace.
    - Provide a second monitor to improve concentration on work tasks.
    - Provide assistive reading devices or services such as text to speech and screen reading software.
    - Provide speech to text software to assist with organizing thoughts into written documents.
    - Provide services and items to support viewing text on monitors such as screen filters, screen masks, tinting tools, and the ability to control font size, style, and contrast.
    - Provide devices and services that support memory such as digital recorders, digital timers, reminder apps on Smart devices, and a whiteboard.
    - Provide software and apps that supports literacy such as word prediction, spell checkers, and grammar.
    - Provide a mentor to provide guidance with navigating social interactions on the job, performing the job, and/or available resources such as employee benefits.
    - Permit the use of a job coach to provide structured training customized to the employee’s needs.
  - Altering supervisory methods
    - Increase meeting frequency to provide feedback on work tasks.
    - Deliver instructions using plain language that is clear and concise and free of jargon and undefined technical terms.
    - Provide advanced notice of major changes at work, such as schedule changes or upcoming training sessions.
    - Provide meeting agendas in advance to enable an employee to manage stress by being prepared for the meeting.
    - Be prepared to provide information that is delivered in an audio format in a written format for employees with conditions that limit their auditory memory.
  - Modifying policies
    - Modify a training policy to provide materials in advance of instruction.
    - Modify a training policy to permit additional time for onboarding to new work tasks.
    - Modify a training policy to permit the use of a job coach or additional training time when learning new tasks.
    - Modify a dress code to permit an employee with a tactile sensitivity to wear an alternative uniform.
- Reasonable accommodations for the hiring process
  - An applicant with autism was invited to interview for a research position he applied for at a chemical company. In the invitation he is advised that the interview will include a panel of three interviewers. The applicant has a limitation with verbal communication but can communicate effectively through handwriting and email. As a reasonable accommodation, the applicant requests to receive the questions in advance and be permitted to provide a written response during the interview.
  - An applicant with a sensory processing disorder has received an invitation to interview for a position he applied for. Based on previous interviews, the applicant knows he is distracted by noisy and busy environments. Because the invitation did not describe the interview environment, he requests as a reasonable accommodation to visit the office in advance to help prepare and feel more comfortable with the setting. This visit will also help the applicant to know whether he needs additional accommodations, such as a virtual or remote interview to minimize distractions.

The website https://mentra.com provides some [more ideas](https://www.mentra.com/top-ten-accommodations-for-neurodivergent). Their most popular accommodations are mostly included in the above list, with the additions of:

- Uninterrupted work time
- Interviewer experienced with neurodiversity
- Extra time
- Allowance of fidgeting devices
- Closed captioning and recorded meetings

## Getting a Diagnosis

This, again, differs by country. I will give you the process for The Netherlands as a starting point. Once readers point out to me how it works in their country, I'm happy to include their experiences.

If you want to pursue a diagnosis in The Netherlands, the first point of contact will be your general practitioner. They can forward you to the relevant institutes that can perform tests and issue diagnoses. You might need to do some research up front and let them know which institute can help you with this challenge. Once forwarded, you will be most likely put on a waiting list, which can be a few months to a year. It is a lengthy process, but it can be worth it if you plan to rely on medication or want to receive specialized therapy to help you with your challenges.

### Self-Diagnosing

There is nothing wrong with educating yourself and trying to find a self-diagnosis. A caveat, though, highlighted by an infuriating statement:

> We all are a little bit ADHD. \*giggle\*
>
> -- insensitive people

While this tone-deaf statement invalidates the very real suffering people with {{< term "ADHD" >}} face, it is also, unfortunately, true. Everybody has _some_ {{< term "ADHD" >}} symptoms, sometimes. We all misplaced our keys at some point. We all forgot a birthday, we all were late to an appointment. Sometimes. What makes it a disorder, then? The large set of symptoms that are there all the time. It is not a phase. People might be able to manage it better and find coping mechanisms, but it never goes away.

Where do you draw the line then? There are well-established criteria[^adhd_criteria] and a professional probably has a better chance of getting it "right", than a layperson. An official diagnosis can give you access to resources you would otherwise not have. Apart from that, I would like to stress:

[^adhd_criteria]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t3/

> You don’t need a diagnosis to be neurodivergent.
>
> You don’t need a diagnosis to deserve support.
>
> -- [neurodiversityglobal.com](https://neurodiversityglobal.com/missed-diagnosis/)

## ADHD Medication

Some mental disorders, like {{< term "ADHD" >}} can be treated (not cured!) with medication[^medication]. These are not available over the counter and need a diagnoses to be prescribed. For some people taking medication is positively life-changing, for others it might not be very effective. Whether to use these tools or not is a very personal consideration. I can give you some general pointers, though.

{{< term "ADHD" >}} medication is generally considered safe[^medication_children] and are meant to help with executive functioning. The challenges people with {{< term "ADHD" >}} face are usually a combination of {{< term "ADHD" >}} symptoms as well as detrimental learned behavior or avoidance/coping mechanisms. The medication can only help with the former. You still have to put in the work to fix the latter.

Prescribing medication for kids is an even trickier topic, since kids usually cannot make an informed decision for themselves. It is thus up to the parents to decide for them. Also for kids, {{< term "ADHD" >}} medication is considered safe[^childmind]. It can help children avoid learning detrimental coping mechanisms and make it easier for them to find the "right" way to approach chores or unpleasant tasks.

[^medication]: https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-medication-for-adults-and-children/
[^medication_children]: https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-medications-for-children/
[^childmind]: https://childmind.org/article/know-long-term-effects-adhd-medications/

One big fat caveat, for both kids and grown-ups:

> {{< term "ADHD" >}} medication is not a cure for disruptive behavior, which might be a tragic expression of an unmet need. Focus on those needs _first_. Medication is not a means to pacify people.

## Disclosure
There are no hard rules for disclosing disabilities at the workplace. Here are, however, some guidelines that should put you on the right track.

### If Your Disability is Invisible

Borrowing from the Disability Alliance BC (British Columbia):

> If your disability is not visible and you need accommodation to do the work, you will be required to disclose at some point. [...] However, if you are asked a question during the interview about your ability to do the work, you must answer honestly. In this situation, your preparation will help you to explain that you need accommodation to do the task. You will describe the type of accommodation, as well as the expertise you have developed as a problem-solver. Direct the focus to successful performance, adaptability through accommodation and strengths you have developed through your experience.
>
> -- [Disability Alliance BC](https://disabilityalliancebc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DisclosureGuide.pdf)

### When to Disclose

If you do not need accommodation at the interview stage, many employment advisors recommend that, if possible, you should not disclose until after you have received the job offer, if ever. Remember, you are not legally obligated to disclose your disability if you do not need accommodation. The chart below offers some benefits and disadvantages of disclosing at various times [^permission_dabc_ohio].

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages | Recommendations |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Third party referral | recommended by someone the employer knows; employer is aware of your situation | little control over what is said about you; you could be screened out | good option if the person recommending you is supportive; follow up with a call to the employer |
| Application, resumé or cover letter | demonstrates openness; employer may be recruiting for diversity | could be used to screen you out; limited space to describe abilities; accommodations can’t address employer's concerns | use if employer has equity program; focus on your skills and abilities |
| When interview is scheduled | employer is interested; allows employer to prepare; provides opportunity to discuss your disability | employer may react negatively; you may not receive serious consideration | if you require accommodations for the interview, disclose at this time; call employer to disclose if someone else booked the interview |
| After interview is scheduled | same as above | same as above | same as above; gives time to prepare |
| When you meet employer | reduces risk of employer forming preconceived opinions | employer might react negatively to surprise | use this method if you are confident you can keep the employer focused on your abilities |
| During the interview | you can reassure employer; you can answer questions | same as above | if your disability is not visible, use this option and focus on your abilities |
| After receiving a job offer | if your disability won’t adversely affect your ability to do the work, employer can’t withdraw offer | possible strong negative reaction from employer | in this situation, if your disability is invisible, you may choose not to disclose at all |
