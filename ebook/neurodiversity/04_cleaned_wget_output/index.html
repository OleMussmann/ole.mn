There’s more than one way to be <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr>. A person could have OCD.

Put the pitchforks down, it’s obviously not a neurological condition. It is not a disability either. It can, however, have a similar impact on people and their surroundings. If you grow up in a different culture, you are used to different ways of thinking, communicating, or problem solving. Those are also the traits of many conditions that can make people neurodivergent. For considering how to improve people’s lives or how to get the most out of employees, many of the same recommendations apply.</p><p>So what is wrong with this picture then?</p><p>It’s not only that people can have <abbr title="(Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) A (somewhat mis-labelled) difference in brain function that creates challenges directing ones attention.">ADHD</abbr> or not, there are also different expression of the same condition as well as differet severities.

</h2><p>I cannot tell you how many of your colleagues are <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr>, but we can make an estimation together. Using a kind of global average will be skewed, due to the fact that you are reading a tech blog (you and your surroundings would, anectotically, have a higher prevalence of <abbr title="Referring to a variation in people's brain functions.">neurodivergence</abbr>), and due to the fact that <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> people unfortunately have a much higher chance to be unemployed (thus lowering the probability for your colleagues). Chance for unemployment is, in fact, 3x higher for <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> people than for any other disability and up to 8x higher than having no disability <sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p><p>It is no surprise then that a UK-based <em>Diversity in Tech</em> report states that their interviewed employers estimate that 3% of their employees are <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr>. However, more than half(!) of their employees self-identify as <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> when asked directly <sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p><p>Since certain factors increase the prevalence and other decrease them, I will stick to the global average to convey an intuition for prevalence for the sake of this discussion.</p><p>The big take-away first: the general prevalence of <abbr title="Referring to a variation in people's brain functions.">neurodivergence</abbr> is 15-20%<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. This means:</p><blockquote><p>About 1-in-5 to 1-in-7 people have a brain that works somewhat differently.</p></blockquote><p>This is a lot. Think about how many people you know, privately or professionally. Would you have expected such a high percentage?

And none of those people told you about such a large aspect of their life. Why not? Food for thought.</p><h2 class="heading" id="a-note-on-disability">A Note on Disability
</h2><p>Statistically speaking, it is rather likely you do not consider yourself disabled. For the sake of this argument, I would like to assume that this is the case. Not being disabled is the “default”. It is “how people are supposed to be”. Even if we ignore the toxicity of these statements for a second, it is a problematic way of thinking that I would like to challenge. During our lives it is very likely that we, eventually, <em>will</em> become physically or mentally disabled. When we think about the needs of disabled people, we need to keep in mind that this will concern us as well, personally, somewhere down the line.</p><blockquote><p>Instead, I recommend that you consider yourself “temporarily able-bodied/minded”.</p></blockquote><p>There are different approaches to think about disabilities. Let’s highlight two of those.</p><h3 class="heading" id="medical-model-of-disability">Medical Model of Disability
</h3><p>The medical model of disability sees disabilities as <em>intrinsic</em> in a person, as a deficit that can (maybe) be cured or managed. You have difficulties walking? Here, take this exo-skeleton. You are became deaf? A <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cochlear-implant">cochlear implant</a> takes care of that. Now you are, again, a well-functioning member of society. That seems pretty nice, does it not?</p><p>There are several issues with this approach.</p><p>The medical model looks at what’s “wrong” with a person, disregarding what that person might actually need. Some people strongly identify with their disability. As an example, deaf people might not percieve their disability as a deficit. “Deaf culture” is something that a person might not want to leave behind by being “cured”<sup id="fnref:25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:25" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Autistic people often see their character traits as something inherent, as something that defines them. Without it, they would be different people.</p><p>Furthermore, the medical model of disability reinforces the stigma of disability, as something to be avoided, to be feared, especially if we see ourselves as temporarily able-bodied/minded.</p><p>Can we think about disabilities in a different way?</p><h3 class="heading" id="social-model-of-disability">Social Model of Disability
</h3><p>The social model of disability sees the impairment as <em>extrinsic</em>. The disability comes through societal barriers or <abbr title="The discrimination and social prejudice against people with disabilities, based on the belief that typical abilities are superior.">ableism</abbr>, and the focus lies on the removal of barriers. It is a bit abstract, so what does that look like in real life? A person in a wheelchair might have problems crossing the street, because the wheelchair is not well suited for going up and down the curb. At crossings, the curb is often lowered. This enables wheelchair users to safely cross the street, it literally removes a barrier. The kicker is that wheelchair users are not the only ones that benefit from this accommodation. Parents pushing a stroller? Cyclists? Old people that have troubles lifting their feet? You, pushing a shopping cart? All of those people benefit.</p><p>An autistic person might have challenges improvising in work meetings. They might be nervous because they can’t anticipate what is being discussed and would want to prepare well to reduce their anxiety. Imagine that your work meetings had a well-defined title and agenda. Even if you are not autistic yourself, would that not be nice? You could see at a glance what the meeting is about and assess if you need to do some last-minute preparations.</p><p>I would argue that <abbr title="Referring to a variation in people's brain functions.">neurodivergence</abbr> falls, for the most part, into the social model of disability. Barring some exceptions<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:26" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, the challenges of neurodivergent people arise from being embedded in a world that is built for brains that function differently than theirs. One way of functioning is not inherently better or worse than the other.</p><p>I do not want to point a finger at people and accuse them of putting up those barriers. It would be a pointless exercise, because we all do. Yes, you, dear reader, put up barriers that makes other people’s lives more difficult. Your boss does. Your colleagues do. I do. It is not our fault, we are brought up this way and we don’t know better (yet). I would claim, however, that it is our responsibility to tear down those barriers when possible. This means actively listening to people, their stories and their needs. It can, in the beginning, be an uncomfortable process. You will be challenged in your beliefs and habits. The journey can be, however, incredibly rewarding. You have the power to meaningfully improve people’s lives, including your own, if you dare.</p><blockquote><p>Disability is a product of societal barriers we create.

If people fear <em>any</em> repercussions about disclosing potential neurodivergence, it will create an oppressive atmosphere where people will <abbr title="(Masking) Suppressing neurodivergent traits to fit in with societal or workplace norms.">mask</abbr> as hard as they can. The consequences are increased stress and risk for burnout. So what can we do about it? Creating an inclusive atmosphere is hard, you cannot <em>make</em> people trust you. But any steps taken towards that goal can be oh so beneficial for the mental health of your colleagues.</p><h4 class="heading" id="dismantling-stigma">Dismantling Stigma
</h4><p>The first step breaking down stigma is working on the self-stigma. We will learn more about it in the Chapter <a href="index.html#neurodiversity-and-you">“Neurodiversity and You”</a>, but here’s a quick summary. If you (suspect you) are on the spectrum, first accept it. You are not suddenly lesser. Your <abbr title="The range of differences in individual brain function and behavioral traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population. Neurodiversity can include Autism, ADHD, ADD, Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia, and many more aspects.">neurodiversity</abbr> is not an excuse, but it is an explanation. Just like anybody else, you have certain strengths and weaknesses. Learn about them as much as you can. Find support for your weaknesses and lean into your strengths.</p><p>The social stigma is harder to tackle. Find out where you can unmask, and how much. If you are privileged enough that you can be open about your neurodiversity, gently educate your peers. Explain how your neurodiversity affects <em>you</em>, where you need support and how you can use your strong suits to support others.</p><p>Working on the institutional stigma is the long game. It takes lobbying, activism, and education. Take care of yourself first, but if you have the bandwidth for it, even a small dent can make a big impact for people’s lives.</p><h2 class="heading" id="how-do-you-own-disorder-disorder">How Do You Own Disorder, Disorder?
</h2><p>Should we consider <abbr title="Referring to a variation in people's brain functions.">neurodivergence</abbr> a disorder?

Please do enlighten me if you have a better approach that is both medically correct, stigma-free, and does not diminish the fact that the difference in brain function we talk about can be actual disabilities.</p><h2 class="heading" id="general-challenges">General Challenges
</h2><p>Finally putting stereotypes aside, what are real challenges <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> workers face? This, of course, differs per person, but here are some general aspects.</p><ul><li>Sensory overload can impact well-being and productivity. Bright lights, noisy visual patterns, strong smells or changes in temperature can disturb <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> people more than .</li><li>People of different have a somewhat different way of communicating both facts and feelings. This can lead to communication gaps (both ways) when not addressed.</li><li>Depending on their <abbr title="The different types of brain functions and behavioral traits, e.g. neurotypical, neurodivergent.">neurotype</abbr>, colleagues might prefer to work in teams, or solitary. A social environment can be very draining for, for example, some autistic people.</li><li><abbr title="The range of differences in individual brain function and behavioral traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population. Neurodiversity can include Autism, ADHD, ADD, Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia, and many more aspects.">Neurodiversity</abbr> often impacts the executive functioning. This makes certain tasks like time management or planning harder. Task or context switching could take longer and cost more energy.</li></ul><p>That looks like a long list, but the accommodations for those challenges are things that help <em>everybody</em>. A quiet working environment, clear and concise communication, setting clear and reasonable expectations… Who would not benefit from those? Sign me up! While some accommodations might be specific to a person, most are “just” a generally good working environment. Hot take:</p><blockquote><p><abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>Neurodivergent</abbr> colleagues are canaries in a coalmine.</p></blockquote><p>They take the temperature of the working environment. The barriers that bother them most will probably also hinder neurotypicals.</p><h2 class="heading" id="general-benefits">General Benefits
</h2><p>If <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> workers are such high maintenance, what are they good for? I could now, of course, rave on about how amazing I personally find myself, or what I value in my <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> colleagues, but you would probably not believe me. Rightfully so. It’s better to let some industry heavy-weights chime in on this.</p><blockquote><p>Many people with neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and <abbr title="A learning disability characterized by troubles with reading.">dyslexia</abbr> have extraordinary skills, including in pattern recognition, memory, and mathematics.</p><p>– <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage">Harvard Business Review</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When companies embrace neurodiversity, they gain competitive advantages in many areas — productivity, innovation, culture and talent retention, to name just a few. A report by JPMorgan Chase <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ea9ca374-6780-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3">found</a> in <em>Financial Times</em> (paywall) that professionals in its Autism at Work initiative made fewer errors and were 90% to 140% more productive than <abbr title='(NT) Relating to or showing typical neurological behavior and development; "not neurodivergent" or "not neurodiverse".'>neurotypical</abbr> employees.</p><p>– <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2022/02/15/neurodiversity-and-the-workplace/">Forbes</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Organizations that make an extra effort to recruit, retain, and nurture <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> workers can gain a competitive edge from increased diversity in skills, ways of thinking, and approaches to problem-solving.</p><p>– <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/talent/neurodiversity-in-the-workplace.html">Deloitte</a></p></blockquote><p>You get the picture. I would like to stress that my goal here is not to convince you to fill the office with autistic people. You should hire the most fitting person for a given position. But often times, this could be a <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> applicant. So make sure to be inclusive in your hiring process, so that the actually most fitting person has a chance to be in your pool.</p><h3 class="heading" id="specific-strengths-and-challenges">Specific Strengths and Challenges

Hiding a part of yourself, hiding <em>yourself</em>. Keeping your guard up at all times, lest you accidentally over-eagerly tell your colleagues about the fun PC game you played on the weekend, just to be met with rolling eyes, being othered, making felt like you do not belong.</p><p>Now imagine a different environment, where there are more people like yourself. Where you can infodump about this niche programming problem you encountered and are not only heard, but get helpful tips on the way. Where you do not need to feel ashamed to communicate about your passion about architecture. Where you can debate which sci-fi book series is better, and why.</p><p><abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>Neurodivergent</abbr> colleagues have a bit different way of communicating, and they are passionate about different things. Creating an environment where they feel like they belong not only makes for a pleasant working environment for them. It is now a safe space where they can be themselves. Where they do not need to spend energy to get through the day, but they recharge and thrive, maybe even more than in their everyday lives.</p><p>With such an environment, work is not just a job anymore. It is an integral part of people’s lives, a place they feel connected to. An organization people are proud being a part of. I have witnessed this first hand, and it is a beautiful thing. In such an environment people are more than willing to support each other in rough times, to go the extra mile and put their heart and soul into their work, and it shows.</p><p>This does not mean that you need to have an organization with only <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> people - a monoculture, whichever way, is not healthy. You need enough to create a sense of belonging and an environment that enables them. What that would look like, depends on the workplace and the people. Also keep in mind that it does take a certain investment to be open and inclusive, but I can assure you it <em>will</em> pay off in the long run.</p><p>Once you create a welcoming work environment and -culture, it needs protection and nurturing. It can be damaged or destroyed in various ways.</p><p>It can slowly erode over time. If vulnerable colleagues do not feel welcome anymore, they start to leave. It creates a runaway effect until you are left with a monoculture again. Or it can degrade quickly by mismanagement or violated trust. I have seen both, and both could have been probably prevented by better communication, by actively listening, without bias or assumptions, to vulnerable colleagues or colleagues who decide to leave.</p><h3 class="heading" id="just-work">Just Work

A way to pay the bills. Those colleagues would be much more indifferent to changes in the work environment. Their passions lie more outside of the office. We don’t have to share the same belief and one approach is not better than the other.

</h2><p><abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>Neurodivergent</abbr> colleagues might have specific needs.

So instead of only catering to the needs that our colleagues voice, we should also try to adopt general improvements to our communication, behavior, and work culture.

Working harder does not solve the underlying issue, working smarter might. Finding the right approach to productivity can be challenging and it helps to have supportive, non-judgmental guidance. This also means that you have to manage <em>people</em>, and not just content. As an ally removing barriers, you can be an incredible multiplier.

</h2><p>First and foremost, learn about your needs. Experiment with different approaches to work. What works for most people might not work for you.</p><p>Next, voice your needs, if you can. Be outspoken to your colleagues, if you can. This not only helps you build the work environment that you need, it normalizes talking about <abbr title="The range of differences in individual brain function and behavioral traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population. Neurodiversity can include Autism, ADHD, ADD, Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia, and many more aspects.">neurodiversity</abbr>.

Remember, what helps you or your <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> colleagues is, most likely, also beneficial for your <abbr title='(NT) Relating to or showing typical neurological behavior and development; "not neurodivergent" or "not neurodiverse".'>neurotypical</abbr> colleagues. What you perceive as “typical”, might not be. This can be a signs of a need from you or others!

You might need unconventional approaches to get your work done. You concentrate best in the evening? Try to ride that late-day energy wave. Having your dog around makes you calm and helps you focus? Make use of that whenever you can. This does not mean that your needs trump all others. Be mindful of other people’s needs and make constructive agreements.</p><p>Lastly, make use of the resources available to you. You might have access to confidential advisors, company doctors or psychologists. Fellow <abbr title='(ND) Neurodivergent (ND) describes an individual whose working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline; not neurotypical.'>neurodivergent</abbr> colleagues have open ears for your struggles and maybe can give you pointers.

I can give you some general pointers, though.</p><p><abbr title="(Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) A (somewhat mis-labelled) difference in brain function that creates challenges directing ones attention.">ADHD</abbr> medication is generally considered safe<sup id="fnref:52"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:52" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> and are meant to help with executive functioning. The challenges people with <abbr title="(Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) A (somewhat mis-labelled) difference in brain function that creates challenges directing ones attention.">ADHD</abbr> face are usually a combination of <abbr title="(Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) A (somewhat mis-labelled) difference in brain function that creates challenges directing ones attention.">ADHD</abbr> symptoms as well as detrimental learned behavior or avoidance/coping mechanisms. The medication can only help with the former. You still have to put in the work to fix the latter.</p><p>Prescribing medication for kids is an even trickier topic, since kids usually cannot make an informed decision for themselves. It is thus up to the parents to decide for them. Also for kids, <abbr title="(Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) A (somewhat mis-labelled) difference in brain function that creates challenges directing ones attention.">ADHD</abbr> medication is considered safe<sup id="fnref:53"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:53" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.

</h2><p>There are no hard rules for disclosing disabilities at the workplace. Here are, however, some guidelines that should put you on the right track.</p><h3 class="heading" id="if-your-disability-is-invisible">If Your Disability is Invisible
</h3><p>Borrowing from the Disability Alliance BC (British Columbia):</p><blockquote><p>If your disability is not visible and you need accommodation to do the work, you will be required to disclose at some point. […] However, if you are asked a question during the interview about your ability to do the work, you must answer honestly. In this situation, your preparation will help you to explain that you need accommodation to do the task. You will describe the type of accommodation, as well as the expertise you have developed as a problem-solver. Direct the focus to successful performance, adaptability through accommodation and strengths you have developed through your experience.</p><p>– <a href="https://disabilityalliancebc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DisclosureGuide.pdf">Disability Alliance BC</a></p></blockquote><h3 class="heading" id="when-to-disclose">When to Disclose
</h3><p>If you do not need accommodation at the interview stage, many employment advisors recommend that, if possible, you should not disclose until after you have received the job offer, if ever. Remember, you are not legally obligated to disclose your disability if you do not need accommodation. The chart below offers some benefits and disadvantages of disclosing at various times <sup id="fnref:54"><a class="footnote-ref" href="index.html#fn:54" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Advantages</th><th>Disadvantages</th><th>Recommendations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Third party referral</td><td>recommended by someone the employer knows; employer is aware of your situation</td><td>little control over what is said about you; you could be screened out</td><td>good option if the person recommending you is supportive; follow up with a call to the employer</td></tr><tr><td>Application, resumé or cover letter</td><td>demonstrates openness; employer may be recruiting for diversity</td><td>could be used to screen you out; limited space to describe abilities; accommodations can’t address employer’s concerns</td><td>use if employer has equity program; focus on your skills and abilities</td></tr><tr><td>When interview is scheduled</td><td>employer is interested; allows employer to prepare; provides opportunity to discuss your disability</td><td>employer may react negatively; you may not receive serious consideration</td><td>if you require accommodations for the interview, disclose at this time; call employer to disclose if someone else booked the interview</td></tr><tr><td>After interview is scheduled</td><td>same as above</td><td>same as above</td><td>same as above; gives time to prepare</td></tr><tr><td>When you meet employer</td><td>reduces risk of employer forming preconceived opinions</td><td>employer might react negatively to surprise</td><td>use this method if you are confident you can keep the employer focused on your abilities</td></tr><tr><td>During the interview</td><td>you can reassure employer; you can answer questions</td><td>same as above</td><td>if your disability is not visible, use this option and focus on your abilities</td></tr><tr><td>After receiving a job offer</td><td>if your disability won’t adversely affect your ability to do the work, employer can’t withdraw offer</td><td>possible strong negative reaction from employer</td><td>in this situation, if your disability is invisible, you may choose not to disclose at all</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 class="heading" id="resources">Resources
