Oh how I enjoy when some random internet person blogs about an issue I'm fighting with, and it's a simple, static website. It loads in a snap. A tiny, sparkling gem, a beautiful brick of information that paves the way for others to saunter upon and learn. It does not need to be fancy, I'm here for the content. And I want more of that. Lo-fi content creation -- a personal footprint.

So here it is. I'm laying down my brick.

A blog. No bells. No whistles. No login, no paywall. No ads, banners, pop-ups or cookies. No autoplaying videos. "But how do I like and subscribe‽", you ask. Like posts however much you want without clicking on anything, and up there in the menu is an [RSS](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/) feed {{< manicule up >}} for updates. That's it.
