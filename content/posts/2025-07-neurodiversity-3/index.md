**Tips for neurodivergent workers**

## The Role of Culture
Imagine needing to {{< term "mask" >}} every day at work, pretending to be someone you are not. Hiding a part of yourself, hiding _yourself_. Keeping your guard up at all times, lest you accidentally over-eagerly tell your colleagues about the fun PC game you played on the weekend, just to be met with rolling eyes, being othered, making felt like you do not belong.

Now imagine a different environment, where there are more people like yourself. Where you can infodump about this niche programming problem you encountered and are not only heard, but get helpful tips on the way. Where you do not need to feel ashamed to communicate about your passion about architecture. Where you can debate which sci-fi book series is better, and why.

{{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues have a bit different way of communicating, and they are passionate about different things. Creating an environment where they feel like they belong not only makes for a pleasant working environment for them. It is now a safe space where they can be themselves. Where they do not need to spend energy to get through the day, but they recharge and thrive, maybe even more than in their everyday lives.

With such an environment, work is not just a job anymore. It is an integral part of people's lives, a place they feel connected to. An organization people are proud being a part of. I have witnessed this first hand, and it is a beautiful thing. In such an environment people are more than willing to support each other in rough times, to go the extra mile and put their heart and soul into their work, and it shows.

This does not mean that you need to have an organization with only {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people - a monoculture, whichever way, is not healthy. You need enough to create a sense of belonging and an environment that enables them. What that would look like, depends on the workplace and the people. Also keep in mind that it does take a certain investment to be open and inclusive, but I can assure you it _will_ pay off in the long run.

Once you create a welcoming work environment and -culture, it needs protection and nurturing. It can be damaged or destroyed in various ways.

It can slowly erode over time. If vulnerable colleagues do not feel welcome anymore, they start to leave. It creates a runaway effect until you are left with a monoculture again. Or it can degrade quickly by mismanagement or violated trust. I have seen both, and both could have been probably prevented by better communication, by actively listening, without bias or assumptions, to vulnerable colleagues or colleagues who decide to leave.

### Just Work
On the flipside it can be difficult for {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues to understand that for some others work is "just" work. A way to pay the bills. Those colleagues would be much more indifferent to changes in the work environment. Their passions lie more outside of the office. We don't have to share the same belief and one approach is not better than the other. It is, however, imporant to understand each other's motivation, so we know where other people are coming from and what work and the work environment means for them.

## For Allies
{{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues might have specific needs. If this is the case, hopefully they will tell you about them. However, not everyone will be outspoken about their {{< term "neurodiversity" >}}, for the many reasons listed in the previous posts. So instead of only catering to the needs that our colleagues voice, we should also try to adopt general improvements to our communication, behavior, and work culture. You don’t have to assume anything about your peers to be a supportive colleague and an efficient communicator.

These are Ohio's guidelines[^permission_ohio] for interacting with people who are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}:

- Be direct with your questions.
- Communicate clearly and concisely.
- Avoid jargon and slang terms.
- Be patient and give the person time to respond.
- Remain comfortable with breaks in conversation.
- If you are asked to repeat a question, try to explain it in a different way.
- It may be helpful to write information down or use images.
- Look past the physical symptoms and behaviors and see the unique person inside.
- Ignore repetitive behaviors as you would ignore someone twirling their hair with their fingers.
- Always presume competence.
- Talk to the person, not about the person. Just because a person may have challenges with communicating, does not mean they can't understand what you're saying.
- Don't take it personally if a person responds to you bluntly or makes a frank comment. Respond in a straightforward manner that explains why the response was inappropriate and give them a specific example of a more appropriate response

This list of recommendations aims to help {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues, but how would neurotypicals perceive those? Would they be disadvantaged? Supported? How do you perceive them for yourself?

## For Managers
Try to approach your colleagues from a place of curiosity. They might not be open to you about the way their brain works, but this is (most likely) not about you as a person. They could have their personal reasons to hide it, or they might be intimidated by (perceived) power differences between you.

If there are unmet expectations, there’s usually reasons for it, and laziness is not one of them [^lazy]. "If you were lazy, you'd be having fun." {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues who fall behind in their workload are usually ashamed about it. Working harder does not solve the underlying issue, working smarter might. Finding the right approach to productivity can be challenging and it helps to have supportive, non-judgmental guidance. This also means that you have to manage _people_, and not just content. As an ally removing barriers, you can be an incredible multiplier. This way we can lean more strongly into the benefits that our {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues bring to the table.

## For Managed People
First and foremost, learn about your needs. Experiment with different approaches to work. What works for most people might not work for you.

Next, voice your needs, if you can. Be outspoken to your colleagues, if you can. This not only helps you build the work environment that you need, it normalizes talking about {{< term "neurodiversity" >}}. If you are privileged enough to be open about your disabilities, it paves the way for others who, for whatever reason, cannot speak out (yet). Be the ambassador. Be the catalyst.

Being {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} means that you get to question a lot of assumptions about what a work environment can look like. Remember, what helps you or your {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues is, most likely, also beneficial for your {{< term "neurotypical" >}} colleagues. What you perceive as "typical", might not be. This can be a signs of a need from you or others! It takes an open mind an a lot of curiosity, but you have the power to be a force of good.

Focus on the destination, not the path. You might need unconventional approaches to get your work done. You concentrate best in the evening? Try to ride that late-day energy wave. Having your dog around makes you calm and helps you focus? Make use of that whenever you can. This does not mean that your needs trump all others. Be mindful of other people's needs and make constructive agreements.

Lastly, make use of the resources available to you. You might have access to confidential advisors, company doctors or psychologists. Fellow {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues have open ears for your struggles and maybe can give you pointers. Lean into, or build your personal support network as well, like friends or family, and get a diagnosis if you need access to extra resources like coaching, therapy or medication.

Let's watch out for each other.
