## Themes

The base theme in this blog is [typo](https://github.com/tomfran/typo),
extended with [typo-plus](https://github.com/OleMussmann/typo-plus) and
[hugo-notice](https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice). What markdown- (and
extended) features does this combination offer? What's the markdown code to
produce certain features?

This is mainly a reference for my future self. Feel free to browse and maybe
learn a thing or two. Keep in mind: not everything listed here will work for
your theme, and there might be features that yours have that are not covered here.

## Math

```
\[
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{y} || y) &= \sum_{c=1}^{M}\hat{y}_c
\log{\frac{\hat{y}_c}{y_c}} \\
JS(\hat{y} || y) &= \frac{1}{2}(KL(y||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}) +
KL(\hat{y}||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}))
\end{aligned}
\]
```

\[
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{y} || y) &= \sum_{c=1}^{M}\hat{y}_c
\log{\frac{\hat{y}_c}{y_c}} \\
JS(\hat{y} || y) &= \frac{1}{2}(KL(y||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}) +
KL(\hat{y}||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}))
\end{aligned}
\]

## Manicules
```
{{</* manicule right */>}} Attention! {{</* manicule left */>}}

The header up here {{</* manicule up */>}} is larger
than the footnote down there {{</* manicule down */>}}.
```

{{< manicule right >}} Attention! {{< manicule left >}}

## Emphasis

```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~

## Lists

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   * Unordered sub-list
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.  
   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).  
   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

## Task lists

- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request
- [x] [links]() and **formatting** are supported

## Ignoring Markdown formatting

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

```
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

## Links

```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org

[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

## Tables

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
