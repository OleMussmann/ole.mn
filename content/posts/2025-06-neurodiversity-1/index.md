<!-- Part 1: "Neurodiversity at the Workplace": Definitions, overview, statistics -->

## What is This About?
> Isn't ADHD a schoolboy's thing? Is it a superpower, a gift, a curse? Why should we ever hire mentally disabled people? And how can we stop this autism epidemic?
>
> No[^adhd_women]. No, no, and no[^superpower]. It will probably make you more competitive[^competitive_1][^competitive_2][^competitive_3]. There is none[^epidemic_1][^epidemic_2].

Still with me? Good. With that out of the way, I'd like to bring detail and nuance into the discussion and supply perspectives I see lacking all too often. This is the start of a (probably) five-part series. Buckle up.

**Part 1: "Neurodiversity 101"**
: **Definitions, overview, statistics (you are here)**

Part 2: "Stereotypes vs. Reality"
: üñú Public perception of neurodiversity is off, by about this much üñù

Part 3: "Break Glass in Case of Neurodiversity"
: What to do if you suspect being on the spectrum or just got a diagnosis

Part 4: "At Work"
: Tips for neurodivergent workers

Part 5: "Common Pitfalls"
: Avoidable misunderstandings and unnecessary struggles

## Disorders? Mental Health? I Thought This Is a Tech Blog?
Do you have a science background? Or work in IT, in any other tech job, or at the interface of those? In this case, chances are much higher than average that you or your colleagues are {{< term "neurodivergent">}}[^chances]. Even if you don't take away much that applies to you personally, after chewing through five blog posts spitting facts about why "being different" might be different than you think, you might be able to support your colleagues better. You will get tips on how to maximize their potential, reduce stress, and create a work environment where your colleagues will go through fire for you üî•[^fire]. And who knows, you might even create a better environment for yourself.

[^chances]: See Chapter TODO.
[^fire]: Ok, I made this one up. But only a little bit. Companies that embrace neurodiversity report significantly higher retention rates, according to this [whitepaper from justapp.ai](https://justapply.app/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Justappl-whitepaper-Neurodiversity-in-the-Workplace-A-Quantitative-Analysis-of-Performance_-Innovation_-and-Retention_V3.pdf) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2023/11/08/unlocking-hidden-talent-the-power-of-neurodiversity-in-modern-organizations/).


## Disclaimer
This is not medical advice. I'm not a medical doctor. If you are seeking help, please talk to your general practitioner or a mental health specialist. Please do use the information presented as an entry point and additionally do your own research.

That said, don't (fully) trust me, nor any other single source of information. To the best of my ability, I will supply sources for facts that I mention[^sources]. Yet even more important than papers or articles are the people I am writing about. Nothing can replace the first-hand, lived experience of your neurodivergent friends and colleagues.[^know] So please talk to them and listen carefully, without bias. You might learn a thing or two, as did I. Before and during the writing of these posts have I spoken to many, _many_ neurodivergent people, within and outside of the workplace. Lastly, I speak from my own, personal experience on this topic.

[^sources]: Mostly tucked away in footnotes.
[^know]: Yes, you know neurodivergent people, even if they might not (yet) identify as such. More on that in Chapter TODO .

You might want to point out things I missed, or disagree on facts I present here. In this case, please let me know via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OleMussmann/ole.mn/issues/new?title=[2025-06-neurodiversity-1]%20YOUR%20FEEDBACK). I will then try to update the posts with corrections or additional information as soon as possible.
