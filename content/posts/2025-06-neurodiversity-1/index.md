Still with me? Good. With that out of the way, I'd like to bring detail and nuance into the discussion and supply perspectives I see lacking all too often. This book explores the impact of neurodiversity on the workplace and aims to give guidance to _you_, whether you are being managed, or manage people yourself.

Despite the recent uptick in diagnoses for invisible disabilities like {{< term "ADHD">}}, {{< term "autism">}} and other disorders from the {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} {{< term "spectrum" >}}[^relevant_magazine], the lived reality of those conditions _still_ collides with stereotypes. This means that it's quite likely that you miss signs of neurodiversity either in yourself or your colleagues[^chances]. Furthermore, the implications on everyday life and work life outside of a clinical context don't seem to be well understood, which causes unnecessary struggles for both managers and managed people.

Even if you don't take away much that applies to you personally, after chewing through four chapters spitting facts about why "being different" might be different than you think, you might be able to support your colleagues better. You will get tips on how to maximize their potential, reduce stress, and create a work environment where your colleagues will go through fire for you [^fire]. And who knows, you might even create a better environment for yourself.

This is not medical advice. I'm not a medical doctor. If you are seeking help, please talk to your general practitioner or a mental health specialist. Please do use the information presented as an entry point and additionally do your own research.

That said, don't (fully) trust me, nor any other single source of information. To the best of my ability, I will supply sources for facts that I mention[^sources]. Yet even more important than this series of posts, papers or articles are the people I am writing about. Nothing can replace the first-hand, lived experience of your {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} friends and colleagues[^know]. So please talk to them and try to listen carefully, without bias. You might learn a thing or two, as did I. Before and during the writing of these posts have I spoken to many, _many_ {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people, within and outside of the workplace. Lastly, I speak from my own, personal experience with {{< term "ADHD" >}} and {{< term "autism" >}}. This series will thus focus on those two, but rest assured, we will touch many other flavors as well.

[^sources]: Mostly tucked away in footnotes.
[^know]: Yes, you know {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people, even if they might not (yet) identify as such. More on that in Chapter [Flavors and Prevalence](#flavors-and-prevalence).

You might want to point out things I missed, or disagree on facts I present here. In this case, please let me know via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OleMussmann/ole.mn/issues/new?title=[2025-06-neurodiversity-1]%20YOUR%20FEEDBACK). You will find one at the very bottom of each article {{<manicule down>}}. I will then try to update the posts with corrections or additional information to the best of my ability.

## What is Neurodiversity?
{{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} describes the {{< term "spectrum" >}} of ways of how different people's brains work. This usually includes {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people.

> {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} is a nonmedical term that describes people whose brains develop or work differently for some reason. This means the person has different strengths and struggles from people whose brains develop or work more typically. While some people who are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} have medical conditions, it also happens to people where a medical condition or diagnosis hasnâ€™t been identified.
>
>
> -- [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23154-neurodivergent)

Don't worry, we will delve into the terminology [below](#terminology). It's also for now not important to get all of these right. Work environments are set up for an "average" worker, with "average" needs. {{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} in the workplace looks at what happens if some, or even many employees have different strengths and weaknesses than the average workplace is designed for.

### Terminology
<!-- START_FOR_BLOG -->
We will explore other special terms as we encounter them. You will recognize them when they have a faint dotted underline, which means that you can get an explanation about them when you hover your mouse over the words. In any case, you can also look them up in a handy [glossary]({{< ref "posts/2025-07-neurodiversity-glossary" >}}), which provides extra context as well as resources to learn more about them.

For now, here's a brief primer of the most important ones.

- A person can be {{< term "neurodivergent">}} when the working of their brain deviates from some (not very well defined) "normal" baseline.
- A group can be {{< term "neurodiverse">}}, when their brains work differently from one another.
- If not, they are {{< term "neurotypical">}}.
- Neurological differences or disorders are said to be a "{{< term "spectrum" >}}", acknowledging that they can vastly differ in severity or expression from non-existent to very strong.

### The Spectrum

Behold, the {{< term "spectrum" >}} of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}}...

![Colorful disks arranged in a circle. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum_01.png#nowebp#light#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}}")
![Colorful disks arranged in a circle. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum_01_dark.png#nowebp#dark#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}}")

... or at least how one could imagine it, or how you often find it [on the internet](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=neurodivergence+spectrum&ia=images&atb=v369-1). Spoiler alert, it is not accurate. But maybe in different ways than you might expect. What does this picture get right? There's more than one way to be {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}. A person could have OCD. Or {{< term "ADHD" >}}. Or something else. All of these would be considered "{{< term "neurodivergent" >}}".

Yes, there's "Cultural Diversity" in the picture. Put the pitchforks down, it's obviously not a neurological condition. It is not a disability either. It can, however, have a similar impact on people and their surroundings. If you grow up in a different culture, you are used to different ways of thinking, communicating, or problem solving. Those are also the traits of many conditions that can make people neurodivergent. For considering how to improve people's lives or how to get the most out of employees, many of the same recommendations apply.

So what is wrong with this picture then?

It's not only that people can have {{< term "ADHD" >}} or not, there are also different expression of the same condition as well as differet severities. Yes, you can be "a bit" {{< term "ADHD" >}} or "slightly" {{< term "autistic" >}}. Whether that qualifies for a diagnosis or not depends on a certain threshold of criteria and, yes, also to some extent on the doctors that diagnose you. None of this matters for this discussion, though. Diagnosed, undiagnosed, self-diagnosed, it matters not. What _does_ matter are people's strengths and weaknesses as well as the challenges they face in their lives and in the workplace.

Let's fix the {{< term "spectrum" >}}.

![Colorful disks arranged in a circle, fading out towards the center. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum.png#nowebp#light#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} (fixed)")
![Colorful disks arranged in a circle, fading out towards the center. They are labelled with some different ways brains can function differently. In the center is written "Neurotypical".](./spectrum_dark.png#nowebp#dark#small "The {{< term "Spectrum" >}} of {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} (fixed)")

A person can have strong {{< term "CPTSD" >}} and {{< term "autism" >}}, a bit of {{< term "dyslexia" >}} and with this cocktail surely also a dash of anxiety.

You have now a clearer understanding what people talk about when they mention the "{{< term "spectrum" >}}" of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}}.

## Flavors and Prevalence

I cannot tell you how many of your colleagues are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}, but we can make an estimation together. Using a kind of global average will be skewed, due to the fact that you are reading a tech blog (you and your surroundings would, anectotically, have a higher prevalence of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}}), and due to the fact that {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people unfortunately have a much higher chance to be unemployed (thus lowering the probability for your colleagues). Chance for unemployment is, in fact, 3x higher for {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people than for any other disability and up to 8x higher than having no disability [^unemployment].

It is no surprise then that a UK-based _Diversity in Tech_ report states that their interviewed employers estimate that 3% of their employees are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}. However, more than half(!) of their employees self-identify as {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} when asked directly [^diversity_in_tech].

Since certain factors increase the prevalence and other decrease them, I will stick to the global average to convey an intuition for prevalence for the sake of this discussion.

[^unemployment]: https://mydisabilityjobs.com/statistics/neurodiversity-in-the-workplace/
[^diversity_in_tech]: https://www.techtalentcharter.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/diversity-in-tech-report-2024.pdf

The big take-away first: the general prevalence of {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} is 15-20%[^prevalence]. This means:

[^prevalence]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732033/

> About 1-in-5 to 1-in-7 people have a brain that works somewhat differently.

This is a lot. Think about how many people you know, privately or professionally. Would you have expected such a high percentage? If not, could you think of reasons why your peers either don't know they are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}, or are not telling you? We will come back to that topic a bit later. Until then, ponder upon it.

Let's break that down into different flavors.

### Neurodivergence Starter Pack

First we have a look at the {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} Starter Pack, which are conditions that you are usually born with. Here are the most common ones. Hover your mouse over the terms for a brief explanation.

| condition | prevalence |
| --- | --- |
| {{< term "ADHD" >}} | 11% [^adhd_prevalence] |
| {{< term "Dyslexia" >}} | 10% [^dyslexia_prevalence] |
| {{< term "Dysgraphia" >}} | 7-15% [^dysgraphia_prevalence] |
| {{< term "Dyscalculia" >}} | 6% [^dyscalculia_prevalence] |
| ... | ... |

[^adhd_prevalence]: https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/data/index.html
[^dyslexia_prevalence]: https://worldmetrics.org/dyslexia-statistics/
[^dysgraphia_prevalence]: https://www.thetreetop.com/statistics/learning-disabilities-statistics
[^dyscalculia_prevalence]: https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyscalculia/how-can-i-identify-dyscalculia

### Neurodivergence DLC

Next, there is the {{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} Downloable Content (DLC)[^dlc], which are traits you can acquire (or get rid of) during your life. The prevalence here is the chance that any one person might suffer from these disorders now, or in the future.

[^dlc]: "Downloadable content (DLC) is additional content created for an already released video game [...]", from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content N.B.: These are obviously not medical terms.

| condition | prevalence |
| --- | --- |
| Anxiety Disorder | 19% [^anxiety_prevalence] |
| Depression | 5% [^depression_prevalence] |
| {{< term "CPTSD" >}} | 4% [^ptsd_prevalence] |
| ... | ... |
| {{< term "Dissociative Identity Disorder" >}} | 1.5% [^did_prevalence] |


[^anxiety_prevalence]: https://www.usa.edu/blog/mental-health-statistics/
[^depression_prevalence]: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression
[^ptsd_prevalence]: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/post-traumatic-stress-disorder
[^did_prevalence]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568768/

Here I singled out the {{< term "Dissociative Identity Disorder" >}}, previously known as the "Multiple Personality Disorder". A prevalence of 1.5% seems pretty low, right? Do you know anybody who has multiple, distinct personalities? Probably not. And yet you have met, and interacted with, so many people in your life until now. I can almost guarantee you that you have met multiple people with this disorder. And none of those people told you about such a large aspect of their life. Why not? Food for thought.

## A Note on Disability
Statistically speaking, it is rather likely you do not consider yourself disabled. For the sake of this argument, I would like to assume that this is the case. Not being disabled is the "default". It is "how people are supposed to be". Even if we ignore the toxicity of these statements for a second, it is a problematic way of thinking that I would like to challenge. During our lives it is very likely that we, eventually, _will_ become physically or mentally disabled. When we think about the needs of disabled people, we need to keep in mind that this will concern us as well, personally, somewhere down the line.

> Instead, I recommend that you consider yourself "temporarily able-bodied/minded".

There are different approaches to think about disabilities. Let's highlight two of those.

### Medical Model of Disability

The medical model of disability sees disabilities as _intrinsic_ in a person, as a deficit that can (maybe) be cured or managed. You have difficulties walking? Here, take this exo-skeleton. You are became deaf? A [cochlear implant](https://www.healthline.com/health/cochlear-implant) takes care of that. Now you are, again, a well-functioning member of society. That seems pretty nice, does it not?

There are several issues with this approach.

The medical model looks at what's "wrong" with a person, disregarding what that person might actually need. Some people strongly identify with their disability. As an example, deaf people might not percieve their disability as a deficit. "Deaf culture" is something that a person might not want to leave behind by being "cured"[^deaf_culture]. Autistic people often see their character traits as something inherent, as something that defines them. Without it, they would be different people.

[^deaf_culture]: https://www.healthline.com/health/why-cochlear-implants-are-bad

Furthermore, the medical model of disability reinforces the stigma of disability, as something to be avoided, to be feared, especially if we see ourselves as temporarily able-bodied/minded.

Can we think about disabilities in a different way?

### Social Model of Disability

The social model of disability sees the impairment as _extrinsic_. The disability comes through societal barriers or {{< term "ableism" >}}, and the focus lies on the removal of barriers. It is a bit abstract, so what does that look like in real life? A person in a wheelchair might have problems crossing the street, because the wheelchair is not well suited for going up and down the curb. At crossings, the curb is often lowered. This enables wheelchair users to safely cross the street, it literally removes a barrier. The kicker is that wheelchair users are not the only ones that benefit from this accommodation. Parents pushing a stroller? Cyclists? Old people that have troubles lifting their feet? You, pushing a shopping cart? All of those people benefit.

An autistic person might have challenges improvising in work meetings. They might be nervous because they can't anticipate what is being discussed and would want to prepare well to reduce their anxiety. Imagine that your work meetings had a well-defined title and agenda. Even if you are not autistic yourself, would that not be nice? You could see at a glance what the meeting is about and assess if you need to do some last-minute preparations.

I would argue that {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} falls, for the most part, into the social model of disability. Barring some exceptions[^autism_medical], the challenges of neurodivergent people arise from being embedded in a world that is built for brains that function differently than theirs. One way of functioning is not inherently better or worse than the other.

[^autism_medical]: If an autistic person feels so uncomfortable in their own body that they want to tear the skin off their bones, than this is something inherent in that person. No degree of accomodation will be able to fix that.

I do not want to point a finger at people and accuse them of putting up those barriers. It would be a pointless exercise, because we all do. Yes, you, dear reader, put up barriers that makes other people's lives more difficult. Your boss does. Your colleagues do. I do. It is not our fault, we are brought up this way and we don't know better (yet). I would claim, however, that it is our responsibility to tear down those barriers when possible. This means actively listening to people, their stories and their needs. It can, in the beginning, be an uncomfortable process. You will be challenged in your beliefs and habits. The journey can be, however, incredibly rewarding. You have the power to meaningfully improve people's lives, including your own, if you dare.

>  Disability is a product of societal barriers we create. This means that we can take those barriers away again.

### Accomodations

Our {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues can be more sensitive to barriers in the workplace than our {{< term "neurotypical" >}} ones. We can see them as canaries in a coal mine, as means to "take the temperature" of our ways of working. The barriers that bother them most will probably also hinder neurotypicals. Who would not like to have a quiet place to focus sometimes? Who would not benefit from clear, concise communication?

> The aim is not to create special rules and accommodations specifically for {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues. It is to improve all of our lives.
