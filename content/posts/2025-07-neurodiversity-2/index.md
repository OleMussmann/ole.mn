END_FOR_EBOOK -->

## Public Perception
You have read now quite a bit about what {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} means and how many people are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}. You may wonder how on earth you have underestimated the extent of how many people think differently. Rest assured, there are good reasons for that. Almost the entirety of this post is dedicated to exloring the various ways how {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} can fly under the radar.

## Invisible Disabilities
{{< term "Neurodivergence" >}} is, for the most part, invisible. People on the {{< term "spectrum" >}} usually do not have any symptoms that can be spotted from the outside. Their {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} might even be invisible to themselves. Why, though, would people not realize they themselves are on the spectrum? Or if they do know, why would they not share this fact with you? Let's explore the many reasons together.

### Lack of Knowledge
Many {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people do indeed not know they are on the spectrum. More and more people get their diagnoses later in their adult life[^ft]. Why would that be? Our social environment shapes our self-image. We tend to surround ourselves with people who we feel comfortable with, with whom we feel at ease interacting with. {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} people might surround themselves with like-minded people, not realizing that a large part of the population thinks and behaves a bit differently. Yes, being smart humans and all, we have the [Theory of Mind](https://www.simplypsychology.org/theory-of-mind.html), and on a general level we know that other people have different needs, desires etc. It happens not often, but regularly, that I meet people who approach life from a very different angle, or people that are driven by something that is alien to me. Maybe you have experienced the same? Our tendency to assume that people that surround us think like we do makes us underestimate the extent of how diverse humans actually are.

[^ft]: https://www.ft.com/content/e1ec787f-9089-4afb-9e53-8e69e3d45405

If a person does not know they are on the {{< term "spectrum" >}}, they cannot communicate it to their environment. Certain needs tied to their {{< term "neurotype" >}} might not be obvious to them.

To understand where this lack of knowledge comes from, let's play.

### "Diagnose Random People": A Game
Let's play a game. I will show you some images, and you tell me the mental disorder the depicted might have [^game]. What disorder could this feline suffer from?

[^game]: This is for instructional purposes only. _Please do not do this in real life._

![Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh jumping up and down](./film__4196-the-tigger-movie--hi_res-2efa8963.jpg#small "Image from [intofilm.org](https://www.intofilm.org/films/4196), © DISNEY")

Tigger from Winnie-the-Pooh has tons of energy, is often in other people's faces (being "too much?"), has attention issues and bounces on his tail a lot.

{{< details summary="Solution" >}}
One could say that Tigger has a Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
{{< /details >}}

How about "real" people instead of cartoons? What disorder would you attribute to Sheldon?

![Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory series, looking smug](./sheldon.jpg#small "Image from [fandom.com](https://freshy-kanal-cinematic-wiki.fandom.com/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper), © Warner Bros.")

Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory series is an unworldly nerd. He is self-centerd, highly intelligent, has sensory issues and can't really relate to other people and their needs. This combination makes him come across as rude.

{{< details summary="Solution" >}}
This sounds a lot like he could suffer from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
{{< /details >}}

We have certain ideas what neurodivergent people "should" look like. A typical {{< term "autistic" >}} person is usually an aloof white male. A person suffering from {{< term "ADHD" >}} would be, surprise, also white and male, maybe a boy. For the off chance that it's a women, then she's young, bubbly and has a fun personality. And yeah, of course she's also white. The lived reality is usually rather different. Let's dismantle some stereotypes.

### Stereotypes
<!-- START_FOR_BLOG -->
In the [previous post]({{< ref "posts/2025-06-neurodiversity-1" >}}) I hinted at the fact that mental disorders can express themselves in different ways. Here's a concrete example. The "inattentive type" {{< term "ADHD" >}} causes restlessness in the mind, not in the body. Think about a scatterbrained professor[^professor]. This is also the dominant type in women and often underdiagnosed [^underdiagnosed]. Women, people of color, and queer people are late- or underdiagnosed for neurodivergent disorders in general[^adhd_color] [^ps_today].

Another shocker, {{< term "autistic" >}} people usually _don't_ lack empathy. They communicate and perceive feelings differently and the mismatch lies in the communication, not the empathy[^empathy]. Some autistic people are even unusually strongly tuned in to other people's emotions and feelings[^hyper_empathy], which can be a blessing and a curse.

### Playing "Spot the Depressed Person"

Last game, spot the depressed person.

![People are sitting in a metro. In the foreground, a grumpy old man. Next to him the text "Steffen has depression". Slightly blurry, in the background are two more happy looking people. Next to one is written "This is Steffen".](./depression.jpg "Image from [@The_AdProfessor](https://x.com/The_AdProfessor/status/1746913856935579716), © deutsche-depressionshilfe.de")

We have certain expectations of what a depressed person "should" look like. Sad and probably introvert. Instead, they usually put on a happy face for the world. It's almost like they are wearing a mask. A similar thing happens for other mental conditions. People usually try to blend in and appear "normal"[^masking].

[^masking]: https://www.psychreg.org/masking-what-why-neurodivergent-people-do-it/

### Masking

We often act a certain way to camouflage into our social environment. This is called "{{< term "masking" >}}" and {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people do this _a lot_. Why would that be? Maybe a cheesy Instagram meme has the answer.

> Society: Be yourself.
>
> Society: No, not like that!

Ignoring a maybe unhealthy layer of victimization, there is a kernel of truth here. By the time kids with {{< term "ADHD" >}} are 10 years old, they could receive _in school alone_ 20.000(!) more negative comments than their peers[^negative_comments]. What would that do to someone's self-esteem? Whether we like it or not, humans are social animals and we rely on being accepted into our "tribe". Behavior that goes against societal expectations is corrected harshly.

[^negative_comments]: https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/23971/pediatrics/dont-let-adhd-crush-childrens-self-esteem

{{< term "Masking" >}} is a learned coping strategy to blend in. This is not necessarily a conscious process and it costs a lot of energy, increases stress and increases the risk for burnout[^burnout]. Trying to act like you are a different person also erodes the sense of self[^self]. At the end of the day, who are you, really? Where does the mask end and the _you_ start? It's not a healthy process.

[^burnout]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-neurodivergence/202405/burnout-and-neurodiversity
[^self]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/positively-different/202411/the-strain-of-masking-reclaiming-our-neurodivergent-selves

I'm not saying nobody should {{< term "mask" >}} anymore; the little devil on our shoulders should not take over our lives. We live in a society and we need to get along with each other. {{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} is _not_ an excuse for bad behavior. {{< term "Masking" >}}, however, needs to become a more conscious process. Furthermore, {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people need to find environments where they can take their mask off and let their guard down to recharge.

### Stigma
On one hand, stigma are bad. It perpetuates negative attitudes and stereotypes, othering people. On the other hand, nobody wants to have a disorder. It sounds yicky, and bad, right?

When talking about stigma, we need to have a look at the various forms it can come in[^stigma].

- First, there's the self-stigma. After missing the already extended deadline _again_, one might feel ashamed. Why can other people do this simple task, yet I cannot?

- Next, there's the social stigma. What are our peers thinking about us? Here's where {{< term "masking" >}} comes in. We usually strive to be accepted by our environment.

- Lastly there's the institutional stigma. This is structural discrimination in education, the workplace, or healthcare.

[^stigma]: https://www.mindworksmemphis.com/blog/breaking-down-stigmas-around-neurodiversity

A special note about the institutional stigma. Some people cannot afford to lose their job, be it that they need the income, be it that their visa depends on being employed. If people fear _any_ repercussions about disclosing potential neurodivergence, it will create an oppressive atmosphere where people will {{< term "mask" >}} as hard as they can. The consequences are increased stress and risk for burnout. So what can we do about it? Creating an inclusive atmosphere is hard, you cannot _make_ people trust you. But any steps taken towards that goal can be oh so beneficial for the mental health of your colleagues.

#### Dismantling Stigma

<!-- START_FOR_BLOG -->
The first step breaking down stigma is working on the self-stigma. We will learn more about it in the [Chapter "Neurodiversity and You"]({{< ref "posts/2025-07-neurodiversity-3#neurodiversity-and-you" >}}) of [Part 4: "Break Glass in Case of Neurodiversity"]({{< ref "posts/2025-07-neurodiversity-4" >}}), but here's a quick summary. If you (suspect you) are on the spectrum, first accept it. You are not suddenly lesser. Your {{< term "neurodiversity" >}} is not an excuse, but it is an explanation. Just like anybody else, you have certain strengths and weaknesses. Learn about them as much as you can. Find support for your weaknesses and lean into your strengths.

The social stigma is harder to tackle. Find out where you can unmask, and how much. If you are privileged enough that you can be open about your neurodiversity, gently educate your peers. Explain how your neurodiversity affects _you_, where you need support and how you can use your strong suits to support others.

Working on the institutional stigma is the long game. It takes lobbying, activism, and education. Take care of yourself first, but if you have the bandwidth for it, even a small dent can make a big impact for people's lives.

## How Do You Own Disorder, Disorder?
Should we consider {{< term "neurodivergence" >}} a disorder? When we look at {{< term "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)" >}} or {{< term "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder" >}}, then, well, the disorder is in the name. With 15-20% of the population being {{< term "neurodivergent" >}}[^so_many_people], is it actually a disorder, or is it a natural variation of how people are?

[^so_many_people]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732033/

Names carry power. {{< term "ADHD" >}}, for example, is not characterized by a lack of attention, the challenge is _directing_ one's attention. This promotes a wrong impression of that disorder. Even disregarding this, with the stigma surrounding "disorder", the above names are problematic[^orchestratehealth] [^resilientmindcounseling] [^psychologytoday_disorder].

[^orchestratehealth]: https://www.orchestratehealth.com/neurodivergence-its-not-an-illness-that-needs-a-cure/

I don't know how to better describe them, so for now I grudgingly perpetuate this institutional stigma. Please do enlighten me if you have a better approach that is both medically correct, stigma-free, and does not diminish the fact that the difference in brain function we talk about can be actual disabilities.

## General Challenges

Finally putting stereotypes aside, what are real challenges {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} workers face? This, of course, differs per person, but here are some general aspects.

- Sensory overload can impact well-being and productivity. Bright lights, noisy visual patterns, strong smells or changes in temperature can disturb {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} people more than {{< term "neurotypicals" >}}.
- People of different {{< term "neurotypes" >}} have a somewhat different way of communicating both facts and feelings. This can lead to communication gaps (both ways) when not addressed.
- Depending on their {{< term "neurotype" >}}, colleagues might prefer to work in teams, or solitary. A social environment can be very draining for, for example, some autistic people.
- {{< term "Neurodiversity" >}} often impacts the executive functioning. This makes certain tasks like time management or planning harder. Task or context switching could take longer and cost more energy.

That looks like a long list, but the accommodations for those challenges are things that help _everybody_. A quiet working environment, clear and concise communication, setting clear and reasonable expectations... Who would not benefit from those? Sign me up! While some accommodations might be specific to a person, most are "just" a generally good working environment. Hot take:

> {{< term "Neurodivergent" >}} colleagues are canaries in a coalmine.

They take the temperature of the working environment. The barriers that bother them most will probably also hinder neurotypicals.

## General Benefits

If {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} workers are such high maintenance, what are they good for? I could now, of course, rave on about how amazing I personally find myself, or what I value in my {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} colleagues, but you would probably not believe me. Rightfully so. It's better to let some industry heavy-weights chime in on this.

> Many people with neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and {{< term "dyslexia" >}} have extraordinary skills, including in pattern recognition, memory, and mathematics.
>
> -- [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage)

> When companies embrace neurodiversity, they gain competitive advantages in many areas — productivity, innovation, culture and talent retention, to name just a few. A report by JPMorgan Chase [found](https://www.ft.com/content/ea9ca374-6780-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3) in _Financial Times_ (paywall) that professionals in its Autism at Work initiative made fewer errors and were 90% to 140% more productive than {{< term "neurotypical" >}} employees.
>
> -- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2022/02/15/neurodiversity-and-the-workplace/)

> Organizations that make an extra effort to recruit, retain, and nurture {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} workers can gain a competitive edge from increased diversity in skills, ways of thinking, and approaches to problem-solving.
>
> -- [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/talent/neurodiversity-in-the-workplace.html)

You get the picture. I would like to stress that my goal here is not to convince you to fill the office with autistic people. You should hire the most fitting person for a given position. But often times, this could be a {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} applicant. So make sure to be inclusive in your hiring process, so that the actually most fitting person has a chance to be in your pool.

### Specific Strengths and Challenges

Different flavors of neurodiversity can be the source of different strengths and weaknesses. While this, of course, is very dependent on the person, here are some trends[^neurobox] [^brain_charity] [^hsqe].
