## Neurodiversity and You

Suspecting or finding out that you are {{< term "neurodivergent" >}} can be confusing or disorienting. Know that the "labels" of specific neurodivergences do not change who you are. While some find it comforting to accept a label (the struggle has a name now), others reject labels for themselves, especially when some still have stigmas attached to them. What is important – whether on a spectrum or not – are your needs. Disregarding whether you accept those labels or not, they can help you find out more about how your brain works and what you need to be balanced and productive.

You spent your whole life being you. The things _you_ find typical, like the things you find easy or hard, might be perceived rather differently by your colleagues. This can be a sign of a need, either from you or others. Try identifying those needs.

You and your colleagues might have different approaches for getting certain tasks done. You need to be isolated, with a warm cup of tea and noise-cancelling headphones? Go for it. You need to be surrounded by colleagues that hold you accountable and spur you on? Try to organize this. There is no one, right way to be productive. Focus on the destination and find your own path.

## Getting Help

Whatever your challenges, you don’t have to face them alone. If you feel comfortable with it, speak with your team and line manager about it. If you have them, you can anonymously approach your confidential advisors. Also consider asking a professional for help. While you are unique in your struggles, therapists will have met many others with comparable challenges and can help you in very targeted ways.

### Accommodations

If you need support to do your work (well), what reasonable accommodations are you entitled to? This obviously differs by where in the world you currently work. As a starter, these are some examples from EU rules [^eu_rules]:

[^eu_rules]: https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/employee-rights-representation/reasonable-accommodation/index_en.htm under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

- An on-site job coach for individuals with cognitive disabilities to help with training and task management.
- Job restructuring to redistribute marginal tasks that an employee with a disability cannot perform to other team members.
- Allowing telework or remote work for employees who have difficulty commuting or need a controlled environment due to sensory sensitivities.
- Modifying job responsibilities to focus on strengths and capabilities rather than limitations, such as assigning a visually impaired employee to a role that primarily involves auditory tasks.

Looking at a different corner of the world, the State of Ohio published a detailed list [^permission_ohio]. We can take inspiration from it.

[^permission_ohio]: Copyright by _[Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities](https://ood.ohio.gov/)_, printed with permission. Original source: https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/ood.ohio.gov/Literature/ERAH_Neurodiversity%20at%20Work_Learner's%20Guide.pdf

- Reasonable accommodations for work
  - Making the work environment accessible
    - Relocate the workstation away from an open office space with distractions for an employee with sensory processing needs.
    - Install overhead LED lighting and lighting systems that permit adjustments to brightness for employees who are sensitive to standard lighting.
    - Permit adjustments to thermostats for employees with sensitivity to temperatures, such as intense heat. 
    - Provide a fragrance-free environment for employees with sensory processing needs.
  - Restructuring a job
    - Permit telework to avoid sensory sensitivities, reduce social demands, and improve concentration for work tasks.
    - Restructure essential functions to be supported with organized priorities, breaking large tasks into smaller steps, and clear guidelines for timelines.
    - Provide instructions in written, emailed, or recorded format for the employee to reference as needed.
    - Organize written communications by using bullet points instead of long paragraphs and section headers in documents.
  - Permitting a flexible schedule
    - Reduce exposure to distractions like noise by permitting an employee to work flexible hours when fewer people are in the workplace.
    - Permit a later start time to avoid traveling during peak travel times that can be difficult with an employee with sensory processing needs.
    - Provide a modified break schedule to permit the employee to manage their needs during the workday, such as taking a break to call a family member for support or to have a movement break.
  - Altering or providing equipment or services
    - Provide noise-cancelling headphones or earbuds to reduce the distraction of noise in the workplace.
    - Provide a second monitor to improve concentration on work tasks.
    - Provide assistive reading devices or services such as text to speech and screen reading software.
    - Provide speech to text software to assist with organizing thoughts into written documents.
    - Provide services and items to support viewing text on monitors such as screen filters, screen masks, tinting tools, and the ability to control font size, style, and contrast.
    - Provide devices and services that support memory such as digital recorders, digital timers, reminder apps on Smart devices, and a whiteboard.
    - Provide software and apps that supports literacy such as word prediction, spell checkers, and grammar.
    - Provide a mentor to provide guidance with navigating social interactions on the job, performing the job, and/or available resources such as employee benefits.
    - Permit the use of a job coach to provide structured training customized to the employee’s needs.
  - Altering supervisory methods
    - Increase meeting frequency to provide feedback on work tasks.
    - Deliver instructions using plain language that is clear and concise and free of jargon and undefined technical terms.
    - Provide advanced notice of major changes at work, such as schedule changes or upcoming training sessions.
    - Provide meeting agendas in advance to enable an employee to manage stress by being prepared for the meeting.
    - Be prepared to provide information that is delivered in an audio format in a written format for employees with conditions that limit their auditory memory.
  - Modifying policies
    - Modify a training policy to provide materials in advance of instruction.
    - Modify a training policy to permit additional time for onboarding to new work tasks.
    - Modify a training policy to permit the use of a job coach or additional training time when learning new tasks.
    - Modify a dress code to permit an employee with a tactile sensitivity to wear an alternative uniform.
- Reasonable accommodations for the hiring process
  - An applicant with autism was invited to interview for a research position he applied for at a chemical company. In the invitation he is advised that the interview will include a panel of three interviewers. The applicant has a limitation with verbal communication but can communicate effectively through handwriting and email. As a reasonable accommodation, the applicant requests to receive the questions in advance and be permitted to provide a written response during the interview.
  - An applicant with a sensory processing disorder has received an invitation to interview for a position he applied for. Based on previous interviews, the applicant knows he is distracted by noisy and busy environments. Because the invitation did not describe the interview environment, he requests as a reasonable accommodation to visit the office in advance to help prepare and feel more comfortable with the setting. This visit will also help the applicant to know whether he needs additional accommodations, such as a virtual or remote interview to minimize distractions.

The website https://mentra.com provides some [more ideas](https://www.mentra.com/top-ten-accommodations-for-neurodivergent). Their most popular accommodations are mostly included in the above list, with the additions of:

- Uninterrupted work time
- Interviewer experienced with neurodiversity
- Extra time
- Allowance of fidgeting devices
- Closed captioning and recorded meetings

## Getting a Diagnosis

This, again, differs by country. I will give you the process for The Netherlands as a starting point. Once readers point out to me how it works in their country, I'm happy to include their experiences.

If you want to pursue a diagnosis in The Netherlands, the first point of contact will be your general practitioner. They can forward you to the relevant institutes that can perform tests and issue diagnoses. You might need to do some research up front and let them know which institute can help you with this challenge. Once forwarded, you will be most likely put on a waiting list, which can be a few months to a year. It is a lengthy process, but it can be worth it if you plan to rely on medication or want to receive specialized therapy to help you with your challenges.

### Self-Diagnosing

There is nothing wrong with educating yourself and trying to find a self-diagnosis. A caveat, though, highlighted by an infuriating statement:

> We all are a little bit ADHD. \*giggle\*
>
> -- insensitive people

While this tone-deaf statement invalidates the very real suffering people with {{< term "ADHD" >}} face, it is also, unfortunately, true. Everybody has _some_ {{< term "ADHD" >}} symptoms, sometimes. We all misplaced our keys at some point. We all forgot a birthday, we all were late to an appointment. Sometimes. What makes it a disorder, then? The large set of symptoms that are there all the time. It is not a phase. People might be able to manage it better and find coping mechanisms, but it never goes away.

Where do you draw the line then? There are well-established criteria[^adhd_criteria] and a professional probably has a better chance of getting it "right", than a layperson. An official diagnosis can give you access to resources you would otherwise not have. Apart from that, I would like to stress:

[^adhd_criteria]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t3/

> You don’t need a diagnosis to be neurodivergent.
>
> You don’t need a diagnosis to deserve support.
>

## ADHD Medication

Some mental disorders, like {{< term "ADHD" >}} can be treated (not cured!) with medication[^medication]. These are not available over the counter and need a diagnoses to be prescribed. For some people taking medication is positively life-changing, for others it might not be very effective. Whether to use these tools or not is a very personal consideration. I can give you some general pointers, though.

{{< term "ADHD" >}} medication is generally considered safe[^medication_children] and are meant to help with executive functioning. The challenges people with {{< term "ADHD" >}} face are usually a combination of {{< term "ADHD" >}} symptoms as well as detrimental learned behavior or avoidance/coping mechanisms. The medication can only help with the former. You still have to put in the work to fix the latter.

Prescribing medication for kids is an even trickier topic, since kids usually cannot make an informed decision for themselves. It is thus up to the parents to decide for them. Also for kids, {{< term "ADHD" >}} medication is considered safe[^childmind]. It can help children avoid learning detrimental coping mechanisms and make it easier for them to find the "right" way to approach chores or unpleasant tasks.

[^medication]: https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-medication-for-adults-and-children/
[^medication_children]: https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-medications-for-children/
[^childmind]: https://childmind.org/article/know-long-term-effects-adhd-medications/

One big fat caveat, for both kids and grown-ups:

> {{< term "ADHD" >}} medication is not a cure for disruptive behavior, which might be a tragic expression of an unmet need. Focus on those needs _first_. Medication is not a means to pacify people.

## Disclosure
There are no hard rules for disclosing disabilities at the workplace. Here are, however, some guidelines that should put you on the right track.

### If Your Disability is Invisible

Borrowing from the Disability Alliance BC (British Columbia):

> If your disability is not visible and you need accommodation to do the work, you will be required to disclose at some point. [...] However, if you are asked a question during the interview about your ability to do the work, you must answer honestly. In this situation, your preparation will help you to explain that you need accommodation to do the task. You will describe the type of accommodation, as well as the expertise you have developed as a problem-solver. Direct the focus to successful performance, adaptability through accommodation and strengths you have developed through your experience.
>
> -- [Disability Alliance BC](https://disabilityalliancebc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DisclosureGuide.pdf)

### When to Disclose

If you do not need accommodation at the interview stage, many employment advisors recommend that, if possible, you should not disclose until after you have received the job offer, if ever. Remember, you are not legally obligated to disclose your disability if you do not need accommodation. The chart below offers some benefits and disadvantages of disclosing at various times [^permission_dabc_ohio].

| Option | Advantages | Disadvantages | Recommendations |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Third party referral | recommended by someone the employer knows; employer is aware of your situation | little control over what is said about you; you could be screened out | good option if the person recommending you is supportive; follow up with a call to the employer |
| Application, resumé or cover letter | demonstrates openness; employer may be recruiting for diversity | could be used to screen you out; limited space to describe abilities; accommodations can’t address employer's concerns | use if employer has equity program; focus on your skills and abilities |
| When interview is scheduled | employer is interested; allows employer to prepare; provides opportunity to discuss your disability | employer may react negatively; you may not receive serious consideration | if you require accommodations for the interview, disclose at this time; call employer to disclose if someone else booked the interview |
| After interview is scheduled | same as above | same as above | same as above; gives time to prepare |
| When you meet employer | reduces risk of employer forming preconceived opinions | employer might react negatively to surprise | use this method if you are confident you can keep the employer focused on your abilities |
| During the interview | you can reassure employer; you can answer questions | same as above | if your disability is not visible, use this option and focus on your abilities |
| After receiving a job offer | if your disability won’t adversely affect your ability to do the work, employer can’t withdraw offer | possible strong negative reaction from employer | in this situation, if your disability is invisible, you may choose not to disclose at all |
